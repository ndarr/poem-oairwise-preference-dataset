the trumpet of god , obeyed on high ,<br>his signal to open the granary<br>and send forth his heavily loaded wains<br>rambling and roaring down the sky<br>and scattering the blessed , long-harvested rains .

some gentle spirit — love i thought —<br>built many a shrine of pain ;<br>though each false idol fell to dust ,<br>the worship was not vain ,<br>but a faint radiant shadow cast back from our love upon the past .
or on some white-fringed reef set up their post ,<br>and sentinel the coast :—<br>whilst , round each jutting cape , in pillar 'd file ,<br>the lichen-bearded rocks<br>like hoary giants guard the sacred isle .
i never think of avon ’ s meadows ,<br>ryton woods or rydal mere ,<br>or moon-tide moulding cotswold shadows ,<br>but i know that half the fear<br>of death ’ s indifference is here .
nay , i will sleep then only ; nay , but go .<br>ah sweet , too sweet to me , my sweet , i know<br>love , sleep , and death go to the sweet same tune ;<br>hold my hair fast , and kiss me through it so .<br>ah god , ah god , that day should be so soon .

so the evil 's triumph sendeth , with a terror and a chill ,<br>under continent to continent , the sense of coming ill ,<br>and the slave , where'er he cowers , feels his sympathies with god<br>in hot tear-drops ebbing earthward , to be drunk up by the sod ,<br>till a corpse crawls round unburied , delving in the nobler clod .
yet though i love thee in such selfish fashion ,<br>i would wait on thee , sitting at thy feet ,<br>and serving thee , if thou didst deem it meet .<br>and couldst thou give me one fond hour of passion ,<br>i 'd take that hour and call my life complete .
it was the merest chance we met :<br>i could not find a word to say ,<br>and she was silent too — and yet<br>for hand and lips i dared to pray —<br>and margaret did not say me nay .

we shall laugh once more as we used to do , and dance in the old-time way ,<br>for this is the pledge they have made to us who serve in the war to-day ;<br>and the joys of home that we treasure so are the joys that their lives<br>defend ,<br>and they shall give us our christmas time as soon as the war shall end .

or , if you will , thrusting me beneath your clothing ,<br>where i may feel the throbs of your heart , or rest upon your hip ,<br>carry me when you go forth over land or sea ;<br>for thus , merely touching you , is enough — is best ,<br>and thus , touching you , would i silently sleep , and be carried eternally .
town land may rail at town land till all have gone to wrack ,<br>the very straws may wrangle till they 've thrown down the stack ;<br>the very door-posts bicker till they 've pulled in the door ,<br>the very ale-jars jostle till the ale is on the floor ,<br>but this shall help no further .

my three great jewels from the crown of life :<br>love , sympathy , and faith ; and year on year<br>he sees them grow in lustre and in worth ,<br>and glowers by me , plucking at his beard ,<br>and dragging , as he goes , a useless scythe .

then die — that she<br>the common fate of all things rare<br>may read in thee ;<br>how small a part of time they share<br>that are so wondrous sweet and fair !

startled and pale , i stood to see them go ;<br>then a long , stealing shadow to me crept ,<br>and laid his cold hand on me , and i wept<br>and hid my eyes , and shivered with affright<br>at thought of coming night .

out of the rolling ocean , the crowd , came a drop gently to me ,<br>whispering , i love you ; before long i die :<br>i have travelled a long way , merely to look on you , to touch you :<br>for i could not die till i once looked on you ,<br>for i feared i might afterward lose you .
the poignant misery of dawn begins to grow . . .<br>we only know war lasts , rain soaks , and clouds sag stormy .<br>dawn massing in the east her melancholy army<br>attacks once more in ranks on shivering ranks of gray ,<br>but nothing happens .
when one forgets , the old things are as dead things ;<br>the grey leaves fall , and eyes that saw their may<br>turn from them now , and voices that have said things<br>wherein life joyed , alas ! are still to-day —<br>when one forgets .
in thy clear eyes i descried<br>many a proof of love , to-day ;<br>but to-night , those unbelied<br>speechful eyes being gone away ,<br>there 's the proof to seek , beside .
where will-o ’ - the-wisps and glow-worms shine ,<br>in bulrush and in brake ;<br>where waving mosses shroud the pine ,<br>and the cedar grows , and the poisonous vine<br>is spotted like the snake ;

lo , now thou awakest ; so tell me in what wise<br>i shall wend back again : set a word in my mouth<br>to meet the folks ’ murmur , and give heart to the heavy ;<br>for there man speaks to man that thy measure is full ,<br>and thy five-years-old kingdom is falling asunder .
dawn with a jubilant shout<br>leaps on the shivering sea<br>and puffs the last pale planet out<br>and scatters the flame-bright clouds about<br>like the leaves of a frost-bitten tree .
yet , o my lyre ! the busy crowd<br>will little heed thy simple tones ;<br>them mightier minstrels harping loud<br>engross ,— and thou and i must shroud<br>where dark oblivion ‘ thrones .

unwrinkled youth and grace , forsooth ,<br>speed hand in hand together ;<br>the songs we sing<br>in time of spring<br>are hushed in wintry weather .
though dim as yet in tint and line ,<br>we trace thy picture 's wise design ,<br>and thank thee that our age supplies<br>its dark relief of sacrifice .<br>thy will be done !

down in the fields all prospers well ;<br>but now from the fields come , father ,— come at the daughter 's call ;<br>and come to the entry , mother ,— to the front door come , right away .<br>fast as she can she hurries ,— something ominous ,— her steps trembling ;<br>she does not tarry to smooth her white hair , nor adjust her cap .
mothers of men — the words are good indeed in the saying ,<br>pride in the very sound of them , strength in the sense of them , then<br>why is it their faces haunt me , wistful faces as praying<br>ever some dear thing vanished and ever a hope delaying ,<br>mothers of men ?
