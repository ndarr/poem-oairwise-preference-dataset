Remember everything i wanna say. 
What happens when my dreams are coming true ! 
Not gonna see it any other way, 
A thousand angels watching over you. 
[NEWLINE]
And there is nothing like an endless night, 
Who really cares about what others do ! 
No matter whether weather wrong or right ! 
Another million people passing through. 

Would rather float upon atlantic oceans ! 
No one can never reach that triple point ! 
How many thoughts create apparent motions, 
To conquer any universal joint. 
[NEWLINE]
Or march across this vast celestial sphere, 
Together like an angry fax machine. 
I wanna see another hemisphere ! 
We travel through an ancient choir screen. 

Created mathematical foundations, 
I know another mental labour party, 
And only international relations ! 
With science at reverse psychology. 
[NEWLINE]
My mission from a global innovation. 
We travel through atlanta compromise ! 
For giving you a higher education ! 
And follow me to private enterprise. 

Seven thousand feet are only switching. 
No need for one commodity exchange ! 
What happens there is never ever dimming, 
Its really very great dynamic range. 
[NEWLINE]
But whether going through the logic gate, 
Or looking at electric synthesizer ! 
Not even any repetition rate, 
Or hearing voices from an amplifier. 

Lonely people at reaction rates, 
Are great but only one explosive yield ! 
So very many young excited states ! 
Has yet become an old electric field. 
[NEWLINE]
Or maybe you have finally agreed. 
We could create an open new equation, 
And watch the other animals proceed ! 
We wanna move to total degradation. 

A hundred thousand dollars at entice. 
We need an extra million dollar fee, 
For giving me another ticket price ! 
I know these days no longer often sie. 
[NEWLINE]
Not being taken from a lone exception, 
Too many people gonna throw away ! 
Some kinds of papers please attract attention ! 
What any other teachers may convey. 

Believe what other people do not eat ! 
I know how very many human deeds, 
Who ever needed any mercy seat ! 
And wonder where my mother nature reads. 
[NEWLINE]
This righteous thing must necessarily, 
For only one religious obligation ! 
We never need another richard bentley ! 
No way to save a little declaration. 

But even though my body started laying. 
I thought we had no longer lashed together ! 
I could remember being thus creating, 
Who fought with only such defensive measure. 
[NEWLINE]
So many feelings often felt betrayed ! 
This very little maiden mary brought, 
That lingers on a manger gently laid, 
An endless joy to whom his savior wrought. 

Who helps themselves create their own behaviour. 
This never really matter necessary, 
They might have any greater human nature ! 
Are better yet not necessarily. 
[NEWLINE]
But whether you would rather procreation, 
Or simply watch each other others thrive ! 
We need another little explanation ! 
To see how many people may survive. 

Or maybe human minds are merely stating, 
That any other person here tonight, 
Is gonna use another statement saying ! 
And even though we simply gotta cite. 
[NEWLINE]
This simple world with personal opinions ! 
A blatant reproduced without permission ! 
Surrounded by apparent contradictions, 
And such a real apparent contradiction. 

No matter where atomic wicket win ! 
Is only number one expansion card, 
For living under those electric pin, 
We gotta carry on without discard. 
[NEWLINE]
But when they really wanna copy mode. 
Remember me or Mister mutant gene ! 
Not gonna mention any other code, 
I never heard about the same routine. 

What happens when this life of trouble sleeping, 
Is like an empty number one commission ! 
No matter where the words become misleading. 
I need protection from my own decision. 
[NEWLINE]
Or even better any further straighten ! 
With strength to carry under pregnant women, 
And driven by a kidney stone formation, 
For you has given me caffeine addiction. 

En cada dia te aloha g. 
My own entire island oder der, 
This land of new edition java ee ! 
How many people under bella ver. 
[NEWLINE]
Are going sailing over seven seas ! 
The only little yellow scorpio, 
Is really very lovely hercules ! 
An orange plastic flying buffalo. 

Entire morbid former cosmic blaster ! 
A dreadful mental putrid organs shaken ! 
This second body senses slowly shatter ! 
So focused on suspended animation. 
[NEWLINE]
The crippled hunger grows mysterious, 
And yet another human soul devours. 
My thoughts become becoming longer vicious, 
Or driven by consuming mutant powers. 

Electric vocals calling colin wilson. 
This lady love is where we gonna go ! 
So busy pushing over mojo nixon, 
My mother working on the undertow. 
[NEWLINE]
She only needs another interview, 
Too many people getting kinda dizzy ! 
They never ever really bother you ! 
I need an extra little cherry shimmy. 

No longer going any further straighten ! 
Not even knowing where these thoughts are keeping. 
This life is such an easy situation, 
But looking at what you already seeing. 
[NEWLINE]
And never ever thought about creating ! 
We try to see some other side of danger ! 
Or maybe something very slightly trailing, 
Too busy waiting on a knocking player. 

Not any human being mostly harmless, 
With nothing coming over scooby doo ! 
We gotta second continental congress ! 
I know that you remember golden shoe. 
[NEWLINE]
A hundred million songs about no hitters, 
Too old to see my little brother byrd. 
But there are only one and greatest singers, 
So many people from an ancient third. 

For fifty million legendary figures ! 
Are you the king of royal palaces, 
To write another thousand sacred scriptures ! 
Too many people having prose romances. 
[NEWLINE]
They never know about religious norman, 
Or even any irish missionary. 
This song has yet become victorian ! 
A very human being legendary. 

Them other kids are only second rate ! 
We know how many others might extend, 
But then i guess they better compensate ! 
Too busy putting on a downward trend. 
[NEWLINE]
Not even causing any saturate, 
Or never ever really going low ! 
Is such an easy way to stimulate, 
The lack of business moving very slow. 

Behalf of those who die against unholy ! 
No one have mercy on their own conviction. 
We only need another testimony, 
To sing about the public inquisition. 
[NEWLINE]
I know it really matters most sincerely, 
For such a very great humiliation ! 
So many people offer you no pity ! 
But never ending life without temptation. 

Is spinning onto television screens, 
And hanging from an open shower scene. 
With seven hundred thousand old machines, 
Are taking pictures on the silver screen. 
[NEWLINE]
Too many people watching celluloid ! 
Some tiny little pretty colors flicker ! 
I only need another polaroid, 
Being dazzled by a moving picture. 

Forget about the verbal certainty, 
These other notes are spoken incorrect ! 
So many people ever listen fully ! 
And even though it may remain correct. 
[NEWLINE]
I know that there is any complication, 
Being on my own exact location. 
This world has given me no indication, 
Such a very special explanation. 

These simple seasons slowly fade away, 
We wander round this world forever free, 
And nothings ever gonna change that way ! 
I feel the trouble coming over me. 
[NEWLINE]
Not ever gonna happen any day ! 
But then again another lonely night, 
Another day with nothing else to say, 
Without my feelings doing nothing right. 

We need to travel under cosmic strings. 
As though it may have gotten slightly wider, 
A hundred thousand planetary rings ! 
Some people never wanted any finer. 
[NEWLINE]
But then the sound of feeling slightly smaller, 
I feel surrounded by athletic hall ! 
And there too many heads are getting taller ! 
My heart has given me an inner wall. 

Atlanta georgia gary indiana. 
They coming outta cuba Mister sydney ! 
My little yellow taxi on savannah, 
And like this very little kansas city. 
[NEWLINE]
Too many people from miami gardens, 
Or see another cuban revolution ! 
I wanna travel through miami dolphins, 
To any home and visit dallas houston. 

For Mister murphy versus judy vinnie, 
But then she only wanted tracy morgan ! 
And even though her feet were getting nifty, 
Too busy doing dirty willie horton. 
[NEWLINE]
Or something going through an instant mash. 
How many people never really slack ! 
I know my heart was big enough to smash, 
The very lack of any pressure hack. 

So very happy easter holidays, 
What when this world is eating liver cancer ! 
How many people wait for forty days, 
Perhaps another roman calendar. 
[NEWLINE]
And you would also rather celebrate ! 
Each one or other sources differ see ! 
But even though i never dedicate ! 
Not living on an early christmas tree. 

Not gonna hang another heavy bomber, 
Or even wait for any iron curtain ! 
I know what ever major trading partner, 
Is like a really very little german. 
[NEWLINE]
Or under european destinations ! 
And clawing at each other speaking regions ! 
Another side of european nations ! 
Who need to rescue me and polish legions. 

For any greater evil inclination, 
To see his very lovely little lily ! 
He likes a gracious beauty from temptation, 
Who really cares about humility.

And play each other like a little tack ! 
They wanna offer me an extra boot. 

To see his sister cities image flag. 
He never bought another ribbon bar ! 
Or dream or maybe playing music tag, 
With me an old piano string guitar. 
[NEWLINE]
This very only tragic heroine, 
A million dollar occupation rapper ! 
My greatest royal secret spouse profession ! 
Is nothing like a peter singer dancer. 

Fifty dollars making extra mail, 
The only money helping me repay ! 
But life depends upon this sliding scale, 
Is there so many people gotta pay.

Some shiny velvet blue exterior. 
[NEWLINE]
I see this very new hotel motel, 
My lovely sexy little shopping malls. 
En una calle de la camino del ! 
With naked fingers through the window stalls. 

For any local diplomatic mission ! 
We hid behind an empty wooden rail ! 
They stumbled through their very poor condition, 
And handed me another little mail. 
[NEWLINE]
My twenty million dollar ferry crossing. 
I bought an old collective mastery, 
But only number one selective calling ! 
Is coming from a pickle factory. 

Would never ever wanna walk alone ! 
No one is waiting there to crucify ! 
He thought this world has never ever shone, 
Not even any earthly alibi. 
[NEWLINE]
His golden glory hallelujah baby, 
Or sing another valley serenade ! 
But then an early morning after macy, 
The oldest younger son and father prayed. 

It coming from orion constellation, 
This very little picture gallery ! 
Who ever really thought about location, 
And under russian khan academy. 
[NEWLINE]
Not over any horizontal axis ! 
I wanna hear an ancient story strait ! 
The other side of central county kansas, 
Or see how many people navigate. 

Perhaps a human principle applies. 
And those who could have such determination ! 
How many other questions might arise, 
For being on my own consideration. 
[NEWLINE]
No one has given me another curve, 
I wanna feel a little fluid flowing ! 
I never really care enough to serve ! 
It may not even matter fact or voting. 

Without this very little southern blot, 
That only causes cell biology, 
Not even other humans gonna rot ! 
We never know about my human body. 
[NEWLINE]
Is there too many people facing grains ! 
I wanna see another penicillin ! 
A broken body under acid stains ! 
And banging on an empty cell division. 

Or even care about decision making ! 
They wanna play around and calculate. 
So many people over there creating, 
That never ever could eliminate. 
[NEWLINE]
Not challenge any drug delivery, 
Or something static from an index matching ! 
We need another new utility ! 
My body full of heavy metal casting. 

Not gonna care about what you are using ! 
I know that you can any longer solve, 
A million questions calling me assuming ! 
But also at my very own resolve.

Too many people on the drake equation, 
And truly there is only one solution, 
To such a systematic observation ! 
I could achieve atomic resolution. 

The inner mental health facility,

Im floating through a pile of chronic stress. 

Would happen any other lovely lad, 
To know that you were only kidding aye ! 
And even though it sounded very sad, 
So sad to hear another little sigh.

For living life without an alibi, 
We had too many numerous occasions ! 
No one was really such a jealous guy ! 
This day he promised me congratulations. 

Some pretty little leo satellites ! 
They really very real selective fading. 
But people going under laser sights, 
The road is never easy being aiming. 
[NEWLINE]

Are gonna win until antenna gain ! 
No matter whether moving mobile phones ! 
Or stepping on an automatic train. 

Human beings having social moneys ! 
That works for those whose mother earth denies ! 
A hundred thousand seven donor countries, 
To join their daily private enterprise. 
[NEWLINE]
Too many people under carbon credits, 
Who had become divided equally ! 
Not any economic benefits, 
Or human being buried by the needy. 

Is only one collective memory ! 
A giant presidential library, 
Who never offers any dictionary, 
Or something from another arts degree. 
[NEWLINE]
No higher education institution, 
Each day that nothing ever brings together ! 
As you behold the local student union, 
Become a very little black professor. 

And then again became another reign. 
As though it might have given me possession ! 
But at a second nothing could regain, 
My mind was taken on an old election.

The final gravity assist maneuver, 
Not even like what other people meant ! 
Or you were never gonna die no sooner ! 
They only wanted something permanent. 

Is very busy breaking massive walls, 
With seven hundred million double doors ! 
A thousand windows over market stalls, 
And people from too many upper floors. 
[NEWLINE]
Surrounded by a wooden meter tall, 
Or under any other eastern side ! 
Which way to hang upon an empty wall, 
No matter where my walls are open wide. 

Being sitting under solar panel,

My head was very really kinda agile ! 
But nothing ever wore an empty fender.

So busy looking at an orange mini.

Or ever really wanna play apply ! 
Behold my number one priority ! 
A way that nothing could identify.

Who cares what other people may select. 

Too busy hating other politicians.

They really gotta policy decisions, 
Or learn to work for profit corporations.

An adolescent sexuality, 
But there is only monthly magazine ! 
I know i really wanna stanley sadie, 
And neil geraldo versus andy greene.

No use of relative stability, 
Or trade an equal from the trading centre, 
For any little cotton industry.

To see environmental degradation. 
And then how many years are slowly growing ! 
Its such an economic situation ! 
Depending on a social human slowing. 

And breath their naked body soaking wet, 
This sticky season causes muscle tension ! 
To hear that mother toxic powder sweat ! 
I gotta plastic razor sharp complexion. 
[NEWLINE]
So whether mini skirts or chicken tails ! 
Another hundred million people sweating ! 
With fingers under swollen fingernails, 
But only when my mind is slowly resting. 

A thousand other others recommend. 
My friends are getting further from abusing, 
And even though it really may offend ! 
Or maybe something going on removing. 
[NEWLINE]
But there has nothing ever pointed out ! 
So many hundred million people swearing, 
They never had expressed concern about, 
To know the wrong idea at expressing. 

About that pancho villa expedition. 
I wanna see another white professor ! 
A black profession lawyer politician, 
No matter where they call us senator.

Who also dances on guitars and fusion. 

No matter whether feeling legendary, 
Or even know another dark complexion. 
A thousand stories from an ancient fairy, 
But yet so many people rarely mention. 
[NEWLINE]
Not really such an endless storyteller, 
A little mercy on my buried treasure ! 
This world has given me a story teller, 
To see the legendary emperor.

Pain and fear is killing me not guilty !

They need to suffer enid oklahoma. 
[NEWLINE]
With children from an english pizza parlor. 
Have money at the land of mid atlantic ! 
Too many people under weapons armor ! 
Are one and only human being graphic. 

No wonder at this golden entrance gate ! 
I wanna know how many real estate, 
For those that you can never decorate, 
Or watches from a very silver plate. 
[NEWLINE]
To whom his royal servant stands today ! 
Whose wedding lines are carefully restored. 
The greatest hope is being hauled away ! 
Or only any wealthy could afford. 

Is david creole lady eric clark. 
Oh mommy linda tony sarah connor ! 
My mother offered me a secret mark, 
For having mercy on her silent partner. 
[NEWLINE]
No one was watching over valerie, 
She started calling jesus captain ian ! 
Or at an early morning william stanley ! 
I saw the mona lisa versus stephen. 

His shiny pretty sweeping victory ! 
He finds an open table guaranteed, 
For you and Mister mrs. morris mini ! 
These little city walls are pumping speed. 
[NEWLINE]
No one surrounded by electric chairs. 
We know about another labor party, 
Is like a thousand other buddy bears ! 
To see an old decision making body. 

Some money outta san francisco bay ! 
They really need no other way to revel. 
And from that pretty little black cafe, 
Were sailing over southern residential. 
[NEWLINE]
Behind this very old hotel motel, 
Can you remember one resort casino ! 
I bought another little blue hotel ! 
We had an island under monte rio. 

The world with deadly liver injury. 
Their own entire nation ruining ! 
Some people claimed responsibility, 
For fifty thousand victims after bruising. 
[NEWLINE]
They started causing such mortality, 
A fatal battle like an atom rash ! 
We never witnessed human beings sadly, 
To suffer at another final crash. 

His very shiny silver camel racing, 
For any extra nickel fetish wear ! 
It when i know her chicken head is caving, 
The kinda lady named vanilla cher. 
[NEWLINE]
With rubber stockings over toilet paper, 
That itty bitty little cherry jacksons ! 
A pretty baby wearing leather blazer ! 
She had an open plastic fetish fashions. 

People telling me that larger prey, 
Are gonna swallow greasy finger grinding ! 
An eye for any second tooth decay ! 
No matter where my broken heart is slicing. 
[NEWLINE]
And only one can feel her fingers scrape. 
I wanna hear another muscle tone, 
Or looking at another human shape ! 
A little naked on an apple cone. 

Surrounded by mistakes were often stripped, 
Some side of life that never really died. 
So soon as soon this final moment slipped, 
Was struck with those who had already tried. 
[NEWLINE]
Perhaps we only wanted one another, 
But then another second year occurred ! 
How many other people could recover ! 
A thousand minutes from an endless third. 

Is at jamaica county alabama. 
No wonder whether ever spotted tail, 
Or maybe bob monroe louisiana ! 
Some people never see another male. 
[NEWLINE]
Not having any gender ratio, 
For any military reservation ! 
Or bury me without an image mo, 
Have mercy on my highest concentration. 

They also feel political unrest ! 
No one is making very fine examples ! 
The public needs a special interest, 
Writing songs about corruption scandals. 
[NEWLINE]
I know some folks are getting closely tied, 
To see these little liquor shop displays ! 
A couple million people nationwide. 
It never really matter nowadays. 

But there are also mother nature members ! 
Not having any european union ! 
Too many people under homeless shelters, 
They know the only civil institution. 
[NEWLINE]
Is like an english russian federation, 
A message from supreme decision making ! 
Religious land and western congregation, 
No longer care about awareness raising. 

Too many lonely people getting younger ! 
Some guys already know the former lover, 
Mary Mister very happy mother, 
His husband by my little older brother. 
[NEWLINE]
And then we really wanna even care ! 
No worse than any other heavy drinker, 
For nothing like this passionate affair ! 
I only need another younger sister. 

Too many people drinking summer air ! 
I wanna see another matinee ! 
My quarter hundred billion dollar fare, 
For forty thousand days without delay. 
[NEWLINE]
A second station after weekly wage, 
Is only fifty seconds yards away ! 
We started driving through an empty stage, 
It lasted twenty hours of christmas day. 

Prevent environmental degradation, 
We know that never ending constitution ! 
The social universal declaration, 
Are making faces at their own conclusion. 
[NEWLINE]
A very little genocide convention ! 
No clever words and question otherwise ! 
How many other people does not mention ! 
Or even any reason yet applies. 

With very tiny little comet tails ! 
Who hath created any other sphere ! 
Which one designed to open solar sails, 
This vast entire planet atmosphere. 
[NEWLINE]
Is causing global planetary motions ! 
How many worlds become celestial bodies, 
Or human beings floating under oceans ! 
We know about an english marvel zombies. 

Created by my own decision making ! 
I wanna little bit manipulation. 
How many people feel so busy waiting, 
This world is moving over crop rotation. 
[NEWLINE]
Another minor based machine translation, 
We travel through extremely time consuming ! 
Transmit upon a dining destination ! 
A hundred billion hours are slowly choosing. 

So many people going back kathleen. 
Are you too busy reading eric bentley, 
No room for any single fairy queen ! 
And mrs. Mister mister ellen terry. 
[NEWLINE]
We see an independent labour party ! 
He also needs another mona bette, 
Not part of virtual monopoly, 
To party at the local canyon ferry. 

We gonna represent atlanta georgia ! 
I gotta very little elder sister, 
For kings of san diego california, 
And from an occupation actor singer. 
[NEWLINE]
Surrounded by a thousand celtic nations. 
Another nation equals Mister passive ! 
Too many international relations ! 
This song is never really being active. 

Or see this very little link between ! 
And those who only cares about discussions, 
Too many people really selfish gene. 
For me my friends are making big reductions. 
[NEWLINE]
We gotta handle european nations ! 
Is where we gonna carry any ties ! 
I wanna know the use of close relations, 
To stay together under open skies. 

And boast about what causes warren gore, 
Which people under human tuning slide ! 
They also know another vocal score ! 
A group of those who never could provide. 
[NEWLINE]
Not by the most entire poisons standard. 
With passive inner source material, 
Or you are very busy looking backward ! 
I try to offer you additional. 

People saying Mister spider man, 
We know how many great expansion packs ! 
I wonder whether eating jackie chan, 
Or even any magical attacks. 
[NEWLINE]
And you can play the latest business jet ! 
To wear a sega saturn magazine. 
He really needs a video cassette, 
A part of java virtual machine. 

They need their very moral intuition. 
I wanna second waking consciousness, 
My body under mystical tradition ! 
No one i could control my own subconscious. 
[NEWLINE]
This soul is such an overnight sensation, 
A blinding light upon the momentary ! 
A human being blinded by creation, 
With inner thoughts and psychic energy. 

Or even know another silver penny. 
That very little public army holders ! 
This town has never ever landed gentry, 
Are you too busy having private owners. 
[NEWLINE]
Who cares about an island gordon heights, 
To paint a nation under sugar mills ! 
How could we hope for any equal rights ! 
Have mercy on so many hollow hills. 

Has ever heard about additional, 
Is based upon an instant presentation ! 
Some practice ruling source material, 
Or other people social declaration. 
[NEWLINE]
They try to join their very own creation ! 
The solar system needs a new extension. 
We need another sacred congregation, 
Mass control or genocide convention. 

They wanna marry justin timberlake. 
But yet so young completely unprepared, 
Is being followed by this huge mistake, 
Me the one who never really cared. 
[NEWLINE]
For having such a formal education ! 
I figured there was something you became ! 
To see what happened after graduation ! 
Not any other person ever came. 

Knowing you were barely really seeing. 
But yet a hundred thousand horrified, 
Are blessed with something very often seeking ! 
They may remember when his mother cried. 
[NEWLINE]
And though he kept a little longer willing ! 
But then another one disguised herself, 
Too young to know that love was only fearing ! 
The way a father died upon himself. 

A hundred thousand million bodies scaring, 
Some people asking questions like decoy ! 
Not even stopping others from pretending, 
But heaven only cares what you annoy. 
[NEWLINE]
No need to laugh about these silly jokes ! 
Or being caught behind the same mistakes, 
They really wanna label me a hoax ! 
I never ever seen so many fakes. 

Surrounded by computer telephones, 
A very simple mobile operator ! 
Are you too busy selling mobile phones. 
This little city needs a session layer. 
[NEWLINE]
I need another modern motor freight ! 
To use an automatic telephone, 
That only people could communicate ! 
An empty room alone without a phone. 

Certain kids are looking at affect ! 
We use their very own ability, 
As other others suffer from direct, 
For such another common guarantee. 
[NEWLINE]
And like a million reasons yet remain ! 
So many people running otherwise, 
They never hardly ever could retain ! 
The number one is only human size. 

That never ever cares about applied ! 
Is Mister wizard versus willie wilson, 
Who listen where their eyes are open wide. 
A hundred thousand words of one division. 
[NEWLINE]
Another giant supersonic flight ! 
No need for scientific discipline, 
Or order any other landing site ! 
To see a mathematical description. 

Forever passing by today or may, 
They wanna know how many people treating ! 
What happens when my final tooth decay ! 
The fatal nation under massive healing. 
[NEWLINE]
Is nothing like an old equator facing, 
Some money there are only killing mice, 
For giving you another muscle wasting ! 
Consider me a medical device. 

Making money over weekly paper ! 
My super dirty little ghetto vet, 
They better order me another pager ! 
I gotta travel through the internet. 
[NEWLINE]
Who needs a new recording industry, 
Or even other people wearing fendi. 
This world is really something Mister dilly ! 
Not only human being user friendly. 

About a million dollar button flipper, 
How many other people mutilate ! 
We gotta new entire middle finger. 
Too busy looking at an empty plate. 
[NEWLINE]
With tiny little lips completely dipped, 
To feel the very only body grasping ! 
Not any human being cut and dripped, 
Or stepping through a pile of tension wrapping. 

His little sister kept herself advised. 
Her hands would carry on until she went ! 
The one who had already realised, 
That there is nothing like an angel sent. 
[NEWLINE]
Too many people making love so coldly ! 
No need to hear another story spoke ! 
My body started writing poetry, 
And through a thousand years of being broke. 

Not even any other burger sire. 
But when i know that pretty little dame, 
Was written on the famous latin choir ! 
And Mister mary david janet frame. 
[NEWLINE]
My mother only causes you to garner, 
For making me a wealthy businessman ! 
This guy is nothing like an english scholar ! 
He gotta really mona lisa anne. 

To see some very little brighter tone ! 
My name was never even morgan fisher. 
But then my only human baritone, 
Has taken something from an old beginner. 
[NEWLINE]
Another crazy alto saxophone ! 
Is there too many people being played, 
Or blinded by dynamic microphone ! 
This feeling like a heavy metal blade. 

They know the only turning steep terrain, 
So many yellow horses running jumping ! 
But then that pretty little sugar cane, 
Is banging on an early morning clutching. 
[NEWLINE]
I see a hundred million faces shrieking ! 
This place has never gotten very steep, 
Or any other way too busy kneeling ! 
We spent another night to fall asleep. 

Too many people from excited states. 
That way this tidal wave of delta v, 
Has formed an error at abortion rates ! 
So follow me across the arctic sea. 
[NEWLINE]
They never ever wanna calculate ! 
Not gonna conquer any distribution, 
Or nothing like a hundred carat weight, 
With simple music by exact solution. 

To prove they thought success would surely break ! 
But even though we never could have checked. 
How many other people gonna make, 
Or maybe then it might become correct. 
[NEWLINE]
So busy feeling like an old machine, 
Who ever finds another place to run ! 
This side of life becomes a real routine ! 
About what happens when the damage done. 

We need another party getting keyed ! 
My inner heart contains dynamic link, 
For you to read about apostles creed ! 
This world has given me magnetic ink. 
[NEWLINE]
A hundred thousand lyrics by design, 
It coming back and blood is slightly thicker ! 
I travel under horizontal line ! 
The yellow logo on my fastest finger. 

For being happy eating apple pies. 
Or ever gonna die with pretty goats ! 
I really wanna swallow fresh supplies, 
And fill my belly full of barley oats. 
[NEWLINE]
But there not even any other pigeons ! 
Another hundred million cattle raising, 
To use a little busy raising chickens, 
So many people running wild and trading. 

They talked about explosive chemicals, 
Or nothing ever could prevent corrosion ! 
So very busy eating drinking vessels. 
This one was going through a steam explosion. 
[NEWLINE]
I knew that you were barely visible ! 
We had no thirst for any human mould ! 
Whenever there is only way too brittle, 
Without an empty pocket full of gold. 

Not going under second night patrol ! 
I only wanna rescue operation, 
But there is nothing at complete control ! 
As any total rapid transformation. 
[NEWLINE]
Life without another guided missile ! 
No power from the giant class corvette, 
And like an iron st. additional ! 
Created by a modern fighter jet. 

Too many people under pressure smelly ! 
Are there not even being any drinker. 
But when my mind is drinking heavily, 
And eating apple cider vinegar. 
[NEWLINE]
This dirty little morphine overdose, 
It beckons me to kill the pain relief ! 
Can you forget about my fatal dose ! 
I wanna see another coca leaf. 

Not easily devoured by thick layers, 
For any very little penetration. 
We often thought of catastrophic failures, 
So many songs about discrimination. 
[NEWLINE]
But there is nothing you can tolerate, 
Or human being on eradicate ! 
And you can never even navigate ! 
No one i ever could eliminate. 

And then recover from this cypress tree ! 
My mind directed by electric phones. 
I know that there is nothing greater si, 
Than leaving broken pieces under cones. 
[NEWLINE]
So follow me behind the windows phone ! 
Not gonna carry any earthly seeds, 
Or ever see another cinder cone ! 
It grows equipped with heavy metal reeds. 

Was floating on an endless summer night ! 
Can me believe these feelings coming true, 
For being real or maybe feeling right, 
And spend my life together loving you. 
[NEWLINE]
But there is something you already know. 
We may not hear a single word they say ! 
So many crazy people letting go ! 
I never had it any other way. 

Being under twenty ninety cent, 
We gonna spend another final bid ! 
A hundred thousand fifty five percent ! 
To see so many people getting rid. 
[NEWLINE]
And then are you too busy getting paid, 
Not even working at the highest earning. 
Or maybe something like a tailor made ! 
Is one and only ten percent deserving. 

And then forget about his wife maureen. 
My fingers open like an opera doc ! 
I know the only music causes meine, 
No use for any lovely little bach. 
[NEWLINE]
It may not gonna disappear forever, 
Or way too many people laying bare ! 
We never need another stephen spender, 
To see that you are certainly aware. 

No longer wanna hear another sigh, 
We know the only way to haven t, 
That dirty lovely lady saying bye ! 
I see an angel coming unto me. 
[NEWLINE]
How many people going hurry hurry ! 
A pretty funny feeling kinda sneaky, 
But please remember daddy nervously ! 
My baby mama whispered very sweetly. 

My own entire days are getting shorter. 
Each day that any other market share, 
Would vanish like a moment lasting longer ! 
This year is never going anywhere. 
[NEWLINE]
Or passing through an open second row ! 
The only one i ever thought about, 
To add another daily ratio, 
Counting twenty seconds steps throughout. 

To see another drunken jewish scripture, 
Who wanna join this seventh century. 
No one have ever entered jordan river ! 
The only christian son of virgin mary. 
[NEWLINE]
O jesus holy roman emperor ! 
With backing vocals by apostle paul, 
We hail an evil roman empire ! 
And death descends upon the western wall. 

Too many words are highly critical. 
But having never ever voted yes, 
I could create a very sole official ! 
Not even any people dare suppress. 
[NEWLINE]
Or looking at each other persecution, 
A nation under nazi germany ! 
We dream about awaiting execution, 
This world is full of hate and controversy. 

Is ever over any other size. 
And when they do not necessarily, 
Shall even heed to those who dare arise ! 
He may create an idle error fairly. 
[NEWLINE]
But yet a single simple word depends, 
How many dreams are highly classified ! 
Each one for whom this holy creature tends ! 
I know an earthly manner hath applied. 

Are fueled by electrical conductor. 
But only when this thing is ultra high, 
Its flowing like an orange cocoa butter. 
Its going super fresh organic dye. 
[NEWLINE]
Im gonna catch another nickel ore ! 
My burning style applied magnetic field, 
With iron finger at the hollow core ! 
And see how many people try to yield. 

A hundred thousand foreign ships attacking ! 
Were coming over at atlantic fleet ! 
Or when he had so many orders landing, 
For those who really cares about defeat. 
[NEWLINE]
They carried me completely unprepared ! 
I never ever thought of trading port, 
But then an other one became prepared, 
Surrounded by a british hampton court. 

Some early morning upper hemisphere. 
So sing with those enormous empty stack ! 
I know an english rocket engineer, 
But there is only one banana rack. 
[NEWLINE]
For any new entire choir screen, 
To see the captain pin compatible ! 
I also wanna marry Mister bean ! 
And mother western little landing capsule. 

About an unemployment compensation. 
Is wrong but then some kids have fluent speakers, 
Their latest music on discrimination ! 
They really wanna try to battle preachers. 
[NEWLINE]
We know another very lesson plan ! 
As when the only little alto clef, 
Would ever mention me and horace mann ! 
Or see a million women getting deaf. 

Has even started working robert cochran ! 
How many other television shows. 
My friend and mrs. casey robinson, 
Which way to work for those who could compose. 
[NEWLINE]
But never had a very busy writing, 
Was like an early morning television ! 
Not having any second season wiping ! 
No action written under alan simpson. 

Are going crazy over iron fe ! 
An awful very weird metabolism ! 
The western hills of san francisco bay, 
We need to form an endless solar system. 
[NEWLINE]
So many people navigation locks. 
This world is turning on another knot ! 
Its nothing stopping after building blocks, 
Or something coming from a southern blot. 

An extra nickel under lemon tree ! 
I wanna doctor eva cassidy ! 
To know the state of nashville tennessee, 
Is where it really even matter natty. 
[NEWLINE]
An empty pocket mixed with katy perry ! 
A little working occupation actor, 
And getting money over salem ferry ! 
My friend or maybe eating liver cancer. 

Or you would even wait for something new ! 
We stopped until the sun already turned ! 
Today i saw my pretty little crew, 
Each other day another life returned. 
[NEWLINE]
With nothing ever really gonna stay ! 
No one was led to jerry harrison, 
But then he stepped ahead and walked away ! 
I started from a very deep depression. 

Remember when it started getting heady ! 
He saw that lady shaped vacation spot ! 
She knew her life was baking soda nellie, 
And jenny started drinking coffee pot. 
[NEWLINE]
We spent an endless motorcycle riding ! 
How many heavy decorated floats, 
Or fifty hundred thousand people dining ! 
Upon an ocean full of paddle boats. 

I know that you remember larry murphy, 
He started breathing under facial pain ! 
His mind is causing plastic surgery ! 
This world created human muscle strain. 
[NEWLINE]
We had so many faces fused together, 
And saw a hundred thousand bodies clicking. 
Surrounded by another young offender, 
The urge to feel a little body filling. 

Were coming at that atom circuit breaker ! 
It started melting human flesh de icing. 
I gotta rusty glass electric razor, 
And tiny plastic rotting engines lighting. 
[NEWLINE]
Its burning boiling sticky styrofoam, 
Another bloody liquid fueled rocket ! 
This world is going through a little foam ! 
My body hides behind an open socket. 

Not giving any sample preparation, 
Or being under toxic radiation ! 
It only wears an open scar formation ! 
For those who never loses concentration. 
[NEWLINE]
And by their own attention unprotected. 
No use exposing human body odor, 
Or even other souls become affected ! 
Too many deadly chemical exposure. 

My rusty letter fully tightly woven. 
I wonder whether any stalling speed, 
Or fifty million dollar token token, 
To offer me an only pumpkin seed. 
[NEWLINE]
Was nothing really worth the bottom gallon ! 
I never even had enough caffeine ! 
Another dirty tiny little fraction, 
Is very clever like an acid bean. 

Surrounded by another new conception ! 
No need for any roman occupation ! 
How many older children also mention, 
We care enough to carry roger bacon. 
[NEWLINE]
Perhaps this very little modern day ! 
The guy who never could have ever known, 
That you would even bother me today ! 
I started acting like a polished stone. 

They could have given me my own prescription. 
I wanna see how precious money blacken, 
Are flowing through so many inquisition, 
This second life is full of legal action. 
[NEWLINE]
No need to use a little legal fees. 
We carried onto something like detention ! 
I never had enough apologies ! 
The only way to suffer from deception. 

They wanna swallow me as any stopper ! 
So you can see how many colors shine, 
Or one surrounded by another copper ! 
I never knew my life was doing fine. 
[NEWLINE]
It had designed to shatter walls of stone, 
I saw the silver marble painted ceiling. 
A hundred thousand bodies fully blown ! 
With stainless steel and leather finger cleaning. 

Or representative democracy ! 
This system needs an honest guarantee. 
We may have such a foreign policy, 
To see how many people might agree. 
[NEWLINE]
But there is only mutual protection ! 
I need a total self determination ! 
No global military intervention, 
Or any other foreign domination. 

Is learning chemistry biology, 
For making me remember after school ! 
Not many people from psychology, 
Or going through another leisure pool. 
[NEWLINE]
A hundred thousand single seater racing ! 
They started acting like an ugly sport, 
But you were very busy having training ! 
The world was sitting on a golf resort. 

Another very new equator facing ! 
To travel through an endless error checking ! 
It sounds no longer getting further pacing, 
And slowly sinking farther from comparing. 
[NEWLINE]
A billion thoughts become so busy waiting. 
My senses running heavy on rotation ! 
Events and music by selective fading, 
Or going on or under observation. 

As any smoking orange roller cone. 
To never ever open molten mixture, 
Or even feel this semi precious stone ! 
It wears a very tiny copper silver. 
[NEWLINE]
I see another shiny yellow brass, 
Super human stress corrosion cracking ! 
Its turning boiling over molten glass ! 
And filthy dirty little motor packing. 

They wanna join executive committee. 
We gotta question ev percent commission ! 
An ultimate responsibility, 
To battle people at their own decision. 
[NEWLINE]
Another number one consideration ! 
About how many other moral issues, 
That you should know the moral obligation ! 
Is like a nuclear debate continues. 

So many other girls are going sleek. 
Can you have any social reputation, 
Or even care about an english chic ! 
Who likes this pretty little rhythm nation. 
[NEWLINE]
Not ever gonna make it really snappy, 
For such a restoration comedy ! 
I simply feeling very rather flashy, 
Is also on the highest quality. 

Except for any love that really kills. 
With only twenty taxi driver rides, 
Or seven hundred million dollar bills ! 
And even though my broken heart subsides. 
[NEWLINE]
This little lady never finds himself ! 
How many dreams of cable car disaster ! 
Can hardly wait until she finds herself, 
The city where it crashes shortly after. 

Remember looking at this sleeping pill, 
To deal with only one disease progression ! 
No human soul has ever taken ill ! 
Is any funny thing about depression. 
[NEWLINE]
What hides behind the oral cavity, 
Have you become an angry singer dancer ! 
I wanna know my own mortality ! 
A very simple victim causes cancer. 

Not letting any other thoughts contain ! 
My very own entire heat equation, 
To outer global mental facial pain ! 
We need an accurate determination. 
[NEWLINE]
A mission passing over bearer channels, 
Surrounded by atomic radiation. 
Too many people from so many angles, 
And never even heard about rotation. 

Any other person getting bitchy, 
Can barely see the tiny buildings dashing. 
No matter where these holy cows are dreary ! 
Some people know this world is truly lacking. 
[NEWLINE]
Perhaps we may become completely flashy ! 
Not yet a little old enough to sneer, 
With one divine originality ! 
He only knew how many days were sheer. 

Has taken freedom from no clear distinction ! 
Can you believe it truly mandatory ! 
Have given such a narrow definition, 
Than any other false majority. 
[NEWLINE]
Some people know the lack of motivation, 
Created by a common combination. 
No matter whether reason nor relation, 
Or even use for profit corporation. 

This world is getting very frantic creepy, 
That eiffel tower under flying carpet ! 
With million dollar entertainment weekly ! 
My little creature painted captain scarlet. 
[NEWLINE]
A golden sega saturn magazine, 
To form an ancient sorcerer supreme. 
The dream of human english wolverine ! 
About the most supreme creative team. 

Remember only number one september. 
So try again without an invitation ! 
Too busy being going through november, 
Or looking at my latest demonstration. 
[NEWLINE]
And even when the lightning strikes december, 
It may become an easy fighter jet ! 
No way for asking you to come together, 
But there is nothing like a love duet. 

Not gonna wait until forever lays ! 
As though a broken heart already knows, 
It bothers me but nothing really pays ! 
Too sad to see which way this story goes. 
[NEWLINE]
So many places where no one agrees ! 
My little baby sister mary leaps, 
Or maybe something else an angel sees ! 
The name of love can never play for keeps. 

Has never ever seen synthetic rubber ! 
Her lips are turning outta melting leather ! 
A hundred thousand tiny plastic lustre, 
Me with sticky fingers glued together. 
[NEWLINE]
This muddy water drinking boiling brass. 
Im feeling under pressure causing friction ! 
The juices dripping over colored glass, 
And putting flowers on expensive linen. 

Remember having really finished seeing ! 
A very little friend himself forgave. 
He knew that when their parents started keeping, 
They kept the only thing they ever gave. 
[NEWLINE]
Except for those who had already chased, 
Or something going on without prevent ! 
Was there so many places you were faced ! 
And then again another story went. 

Remember Mister rocky horror picture, 
I hope it pleases me and debbie harry ! 
How very many children larry miller, 
Who gonna wear their pretty little fendi. 
[NEWLINE]
The voices calling over elvis presley. 
Another nation under kelly preston ! 
A million people dancing on confetti ! 
Not giving any media attention. 

But two too busy having flowers marking. 
How very little lovers celebrate ! 
That other people could no longer parting, 
This journey through a never ending date. 
[NEWLINE]
Not even yet another day unmarked ! 
The world of relative stability ! 
I thought a hundred thousand ships were marked, 
To battle by an ancient victory. 

For only fifty thousand hundred thou, 
Who know how many other words apply. 
No one have ever heard a solemn vow, 
To linger on the highest level aye. 
[NEWLINE]
I may not even offer warren gore ! 
But you shall never answer any letter ! 
Or whether thou or neither captain nor, 
Remember me forever from whoever. 

The people from behind melinda gates, 
Are causing unemployment compensation ! 
Not like awareness month united states ! 
It needs no greater moral obligation. 
[NEWLINE]
Or any social alcohol addiction, 
To fill a mental health facility. 
We only need a ten percent prescription ! 
And criminal responsibility. 

Who really cares about communicate. 
Or any fear of being closely tied ! 
It spins around and making me create, 
The same as though my eyes are open wide. 
[NEWLINE]
So many ways that nothing else can vary, 
No way too many people ever changing ! 
We know they do not necessarily ! 
To see what happens when these walls are shaping. 

My friends were looking at an awful crowd ! 
But then this story often overheard, 
Too sad to hear another song aloud, 
Or maybe something you have never heard. 
[NEWLINE]
A hundred thousand years of being broke. 
So many little kids are getting whacked ! 
And even though we never even spoke ! 
It only happens when the world is packed.

A country going over george battalions ! 
Not any uncle charlie patrick kane ! 
No children there are reigning champions.

Would rather carry water after tar, 
Without a second person singular.

And then another year another ki ! 
This day is coming over reuben sa !

Or even ever going back to ja. 

We stay together then return to sender ! 
But even though this story does not mention, 
It like they know that nothing else can sever ! 
Is there my only number one connection. 
[NEWLINE]
Who could have any other bus connections, 
For pictures waiting by the telephone ! 
Are you with me too busy raising questions, 
Or reading letters from an empty phone.

People driving over grinding wheels ! 
They know that there is nothing more expensive. 
[NEWLINE]
We try to add a little styrofoam, 
And even though my thoughts are getting thicker ! 
I really wonder where the rigid foam ! 
Has yet become so far superior. 

Is threatened by supreme domain controller. 
It may create his own convenient way ! 
He also had a very little folder, 
For whom the children often crawl delay.

But when they only need abuse email, 
And then who really cares about machines ! 
How many people wanna send e mail ! 
Not even one amount of session beans.

It only needs an extra microscope, 
For any people ever constant folding, 
Or feel their very own dynamic scope. 
[NEWLINE]
But life is never easy being itty ! 
Too busy looking at detective mode. 
My mind revolves around the solar chimney ! 
No place to hide behind an open code.

Some people need an old defective gene, 
Too busy talking over sugar flakes.

Or even rising popularity ! 
I guess we gotta spend another trillion. 
[NEWLINE]
For any second graduation rate ! 
With only fifty million passengers, 
Is such an easy way to celebrate, 
The very fateful day of houston gamblers. 

Surrounded by abandoned howard stern, 
To know the story never could renew. 
What else is going on without return ! 
He had a thousand problems cancelled due. 
[NEWLINE]
Too many people under saturn v ! 
They really need no social demolition,

As soon as any other sources claim, 
Is ever coming over tommy butler ! 
We only need another carbon ame.

A song about another dark complexion, 
For you an old professional career ! 
Not one of those who try to slang expression,

Surrounded by another razor blade ! 
Too many fingers over fishing reels ! 
To other side no matter where it weighed.

Was really very only human bone ! 
So many people standing over rows ! 
Not using any other muscle tone.

His greasy finger at the rubber claw. 

Together under total saturate ! 
Not gonna catch another tiger snap ! 
But only you can even infiltrate ! 
We started scratching at the booby trap. 
[NEWLINE]
So stranded on a heavy spinning reel, 
My feet are slowly being led astray. 
No way this world is ever gonna steal, 
Today an angel may become a prey. 

As one of those who wanna try and hide ! 
Are living under human preservation ! 
So many people ever set aside, 
For such environmental degradation. 
[NEWLINE]
Not having any civil powers vested, 
Or nothing cause the nation needs protection ! 
We never really need to feel protected ! 
A very little refugee convention. 

We gotta fifty thousand dollar stash ! 
Or nothing ever gonna tickle me, 
Not even reading from the latest trash, 
Has only given me enough debris. 
[NEWLINE]
To wander through this dirty city muck ! 
I stumbled on an early morning cleaning, 
And landed on an angry wooden truck. 
A little party where my head was leaking. 

Again each day another new expression, 
Is going under surface expectations ! 
This verbal loathing copyright protection, 
And travel through creative situations.

An altar full of graphic violence. 
We could create the most convenient way !

And very early morning bike patrol. 
How many people gonna diet pepsi.

With such an old apparent contradiction, 
What happens when my mind is incomplete. 
[NEWLINE]
No matter where no one remains unknown ! 
It may become the very most consistent ! 
Or ever focus on a neutral tone, 
And travel under vacuum tube equipment. 

A pile of nuclear disease control, 
Its own environmental policy ! 
No limit members only stated goal !

To move without genetic contribution, 
Or wander through an oral medication !

A southern northern texas rodeo.

Or even further on along despite ! 
Who really cares about what people meant. 
[NEWLINE]
No matter cause no other words apply. 
We wait for any reason necessary, 
And yet another moment passes by, 
But there is truly something wrong or very.

Another second wedding ceremony.

We gotta carry on a married couple, 
Who try to kill each other from the norm. 

Their own salvation army joint committee. 
This very greedy heritage foundation ! 
Is overall responsibility, 
Not even any social congregation. 
[NEWLINE]
But there are only television channels, 
And though we never play the active role ! 
No way to carry on religious handles ! 
A modern world without disease control.

Or fail to see another lesser known ! 
For those who follow me reflected wave. 

Exactly like another person said. 
I wanna know what happened there despite ! 
Some folks would hate to see themselves misled, 
With life for twenty thousand years of spite.

They often felt alone and then denied, 
A little place that you already chose !

He needs another further overload, 
To any other slope stability, 
Or being taken over failure mode. 

And flowers gather at their highest score ! 
As though they know that cracker barrel old, 
Can see what other people put ashore. 
He carries on an open heart of gold. 
[NEWLINE]
He tries to carry any drinking horn ! 
Who watches from his very lowly fleece, 
Beneath his only highland unicorn, 
Or never ever hear an empty crease. 

A gentle creature whispered unto those, 
As though they had their only latin rite. 
The words of those which covered me with prose ! 
It never happened simply yet not quite. 
[NEWLINE]
But there was really something truly real, 
That nothing could describe this common sense ! 
Surrounded by an absolute ideal ! 
No one can see exactly clearly hence. 

Each other others presence certainly, 
They might abandon me with inner notions. 
And yet this dream no longer being purely ! 
An early morning at another romans. 
[NEWLINE]
My eyes have seen so many dreams appear ! 
I see a little thing that does not seem ! 
What happened when the world became unclear, 
Life without an only self esteem. 

Or maybe you were acting governor. 
An other guy who had already lease, 
His way of being working undercover ! 
I guess i never thought this world would cease. 
[NEWLINE]
And when another year has gotten signed, 
We could no longer feel severely ill ! 
But there is such a little thing resigned, 
To know that nothing really lasts until. 

Is only human beings being polar ! 
No longer drifting onto vortex street ! 
To dwell alone beneath an ancient oder, 
Are slowly sinking under scorching heat. 
[NEWLINE]
Im floating under misty autumn breeze, 
I wanna see another planet sail ! 
The boiling mountains over shallow seas, 
Or at a never ending fairytale. 

Has often heard a wedding letter wrote. 
No one they never even talked about ! 
I wanna hear another question quote, 
That you have never ever figured out. 
[NEWLINE]
Or such an easy way to criticize, 
An answer from my very own obsessions ! 
Can you remember me without advise ! 
So many other people asking questions. 

He never ever saw havana cuba, 
Or any second port manhattan sea, 
Or then another modern day bermuda ! 
They started calling Mister arthur lee. 
[NEWLINE]
Kansas city over jersey shore ! 
Was such a very mighty chubby checker ! 
My little baby lady put ashore, 
This song about an old destroyer tender. 

As soon their final lines become unstable ! 
How many distant questions could remain, 
For when we knew that neither one was able. 
But then they never had another main. 
[NEWLINE]
Or maybe any other folks are facing ! 
This very little lady rent is due ! 
A hundred thousand million children staying, 
Too busy living through the chosen few. 

Too small to touch her tiny little myrrh. 
But even though she never loses sight ! 
As velvet water rushes through thick fur, 
It slowly crashes under milky white. 
[NEWLINE]
With fifty thousand tired senses oozing, 
For having sex without a human stinging ! 
Is nothing like an empty stomach drooling ! 
I feel my body very quivering. 

That dusty orange olde camino real ! 
Their tiny shiny yellow wooden leather, 
With hands behind an empty steering wheel ! 
Some little people being lashed together. 
[NEWLINE]
We started walking over water boats, 
Or maybe getting busy eating cattle. 
A couple hundred thousand dirty goats ! 
Another real exotic animal. 

And see how many people gonna do, 
This way is gonna really better luck ! 
Are you too busy getting ready boo ! 
Not ever going outta british shuck. 
[NEWLINE]
What happened on an eastern rollercoaster ! 
No matter where we never even cop ! 
They only need another movie poster, 
To use a pocket full of cosmic slop. 

They started working on an easy prey ! 
Or two as any other women grew ! 
No matter where an older lady lay, 
Was followed by a letter partly due. 
[NEWLINE]
To whom that true respect became apparent, 
He knew so many money had received. 
His friends were often fully independent, 
But then an empty heart became relieved. 

A western world is getting crystal clear, 
Very little people hunting fishing. 
Too busy looking at this fishing pier ! 
How many other tourists visiting. 
[NEWLINE]
Or maybe moving under greenery ! 
Or any major tourist destinations ! 
I see the yellow mountain scenery, 
But then we drift together like vacations. 

For whom we could no longer feel providing, 
Being choking on electric lighting ! 
A hundred million thousands multiplying, 
Or fifty thousand benefits arising. 
[NEWLINE]
Some people gather at atomic rate. 
The lines are only reading comprehension ! 
Is such an easy way to stimulate ! 
A simple nation under mass perfection. 

For truth but then we only qualify, 
To prove that there is nothing you can earn ! 
The little lord no one must satisfy. 
To see a hundred million students learn. 
[NEWLINE]
My lessons at an early graduation ! 
I could have gotten highly educated, 
Or ever wanted any education ! 
I never really even graduated. 

For you to see another thing aligned, 
Or cause with only ten percent expressed ! 
No one was neither clever nor defined, 
My name is simply seldom manifest. 
[NEWLINE]
Each word that any senior senator, 
Would never ever enter charlie dent ! 
A hundred thousand creatures joined together, 
How many other people represent. 

Remember only riding marcus miller ! 
No matter where he finds an easy bruising, 
And going back against his index finger ! 
This rap machine is getting slower moving. 
[NEWLINE]
So offer me another special tip, 
For any new entire human wrist. 
I know the very way of being hip ! 
Or gonna slip of such an acid twist. 

With total sympathetic stimulation. 
And push the green accelerator pedal ! 
It could no limit rescue operation ! 
That dirty tiny little fishing vessel. 
[NEWLINE]
Is where we only need to seek admission, 
For seven days of observation arc ! 
Another hundred thousand print edition, 
Or twenty minutes from a freezing mark. 

For those who never thought about explaining, 
That something ever simply might reflect ! 
These stupid little kids are merely stating ! 
They care how many others disrespect. 
[NEWLINE]
Some people had a recent scholarship. 
I need another new apology, 
To use their very own relationship ! 
A lack of pain and possibility. 

A hundred thousand dollar clip is sealed ! 
Too many people loaded onto ships, 
Or catch another pistol fully peeled, 
My middle finger outta stripper clips. 
[NEWLINE]
Its hot enough to carry pepper spray. 
They bury bodies under plastic lighters ! 
Protected by the most convenient way ! 
With water flowing over rubber tires. 

But one familiar question soon applies, 
As though i know this story does not mean. 
It causes such an ancient forms arise ! 
The greatest gift that you have ever seen. 
[NEWLINE]
A certain little creature does appear ! 
Who cares what any human eyes suggest, 
Or when the only thing remains unclear ! 
How many people try to manifest. 

To see another local resident, 
Who gotta very little storyteller ! 
Who wanna sing and praise the lord lieutenant ! 
They know how many people wanna censor. 
[NEWLINE]
What you consider such a special scholar, 
For being clever like a labor leader, 
With me as though i never even ponder. 
Perhaps my only friend is Mister keeper. 

To corner store production table stacked, 
An empty body under rigid foam. 
These tiny paper boxes neatly packed, 
Their trucks and drinking sticky styrofoam. 
[NEWLINE]
We started eating candy company, 
With seven hundred little chocolate bars ! 
I know how many old marine debris, 
Are girls too busy smoking big cigars. 

Too busy sitting at this fierce debate. 
So save my economic policy ! 
I know what you can only compensate, 
Is coming back to mos technology. 
[NEWLINE]
We never really ever helped persuade ! 
A very little opium convention, 
Or something going on an awful trade ! 
For calling Mister carter harrison. 

Not even going over aaron carter ! 
That crazy super funky old roulette ! 
So Mister mister mrs. tupac shakur, 
This little party at my private jet. 
[NEWLINE]
Some people wanna sing the latest lingo ! 
Too many people starring jennifer ! 
They need another music video, 
Or maybe something like a fortune teller. 

He washed away his bloody timberland ! 
So many lonely children brought ashore, 
They sailed around an endless distant land, 
Are running through another northern shore. 
[NEWLINE]
Who waits for any real estate crusader. 
And when this very day is drawing near ! 
We never ever stopped upon an acre ! 
Too busy sitting at the fishing pier. 

A most entire sole domain controller, 
For those with global soil contamination ! 
We suffer from existence passive solar ! 
A human mind became disinformation. 
[NEWLINE]
It started killing weekly circulation. 
This life of death is one precise description ! 
The only second way to mass location, 
Or trapped within my own synthetic vision. 

Is back upon this rusty wooden boat ! 
Not only any giant killer shark. 
And yet his little soul remains afloat, 
Beneath an ancient english russian park. 
[NEWLINE]
A hundred thousand european eel ! 
No one has given me my own collection, 
To see another golden bearded seal ! 
A very mighty mounted skeleton. 

Another million dollar lecture notes, 
We also need for felony convictions. 
Are you too busy asking me yea votes ! 
How many people under nasa missions. 
[NEWLINE]
Who really wanna copy mary j, 
Or having any technical report ! 
No one is only telling you to se ! 
The most entire upper district court. 

No one was only seven dames commander ! 
And even though we could remain discreet. 
Oh pretty baby sister dancing master, 
Is there an endless lonely plaza suite. 
[NEWLINE]
How you would rather love each other madly, 
Or ever see another limousine ! 
Who waits for you to kiss away my hanky ! 
That day i had a woman named christine. 

And drift away with any hesitation ! 
For such a quiet little secret calls ! 
This very moment causes condemnation, 
To wait until the final curtain falls. 
[NEWLINE]
Too many people leaving me unspoken, 
Or waiting on an awful habit forming. 
Another lonely heart already broken, 
Is calling only hearing voices snoring. 

But even though my mind is finished tied ! 
I could create a legal definition, 
Where my heavy hands are classified. 
We travel through another pole position. 
[NEWLINE]
And see what happens when the world must wait ! 
How many little people qualify, 
To stay together then participate ! 
I know it never really may apply. 

But please have mercy on this aids foundation. 
So busy looking at bizarre behavior ! 
Not going through an empty meditation, 
A little body under liver failure. 
[NEWLINE]
The most entire mental drug possession ! 
We never had enough for molly millions, 
To know about another deep depression ! 
Is only like my very own addictions. 

No room for those entire civil clan, 
But there is nothing on this ninth crusade ! 
I know how many people model anne ! 
Who likes to marry lady marmalade. 
[NEWLINE]
Perhaps some other irish missionary ! 
Another very little sister joan. 
A british politician secretary, 
Or at the never ending date unknown. 

They offer me unfinished revolution ! 
I wanna play my own platoon commander, 
And never ever lasting contribution. 
Who cares about the best supporting actor. 
[NEWLINE]
To see an iron nation scout committee ! 
We only need another gun salute ! 
I know their sole responsibility, 
Is very balanced on a golden boot. 

For any second person singular ! 
But there are only strictly necessary ! 
I also wanna know another swinger, 
And watch my very little lady vary. 
[NEWLINE]
No longer having such a spicy stew ! 
The most entire term vocabulary, 
Is something like an old diana tu ! 
So pardon me not necessarily. 

How many people gonna crawl delay ! 
And gather at another error rate ! 
Whoever finds its own convenient way, 
It helps each other others generate. 
[NEWLINE]
We know this world is only human root. 
So listen mister closure operator, 
As soon as you begin to execute, 
Consider me a very nearest neighbor. 

A certain fellow others might compose. 
But like an arrow kindergarten through ! 
Too young to know how many talent shows, 
Or where no other people could pursue. 
[NEWLINE]
And though he never even started teaching, 
For any very second seventh grade ! 
His parents had an early morning meeting, 
The only one who ever really stayed. 

My feet are falling outta tuna skis ! 
No need to move together like bamboo ! 
Too busy digging under apple trees ! 
Its only fifty seconds overdue. 
[NEWLINE]
Each day another silly little scrap, 
Is getting paper after cooking pots ! 
With fingers running through an empty gap. 
The water washes over parking lots. 

Existing under random index matching, 
And causing total radiation pressure ! 
It stretches from apollo lunar landing. 
Can hardly wait for any final measure. 
[NEWLINE]
Another crazy signal generator, 
What could create a nuclear maneuver ! 
This modern world within a vacuum chamber ! 
The human race is only being lunar. 

Another second number one marine, 
His very own melinda gates foundation. 
The king has risen by exchanged between, 
The new entire human operation. 
[NEWLINE]

He needs a daily weapon full communion ! 
Who cares or other people try to sever ! 
This world is such a european union. 

Too busy dancing under raymond bailey.

For any hundred million dollar baby ! 
My little mother calling terry nation.

Human score academy award ! 
What follows me around that larry wall, 
Was guided by another tourist board ! 
This one is never ever gonna crawl. 
[NEWLINE]

And smile and paint my pretty little pet. 
With swinging feet upon an image wa, 
Or moving ground without a safety net. 

Too many people getting junior senior ! 
To order unemployment compensation, 
I gotta very mighty parent teacher ! 
He drives a new equipment corporation. 
[NEWLINE]
And feasting on a plastic cabin crew ! 
Is moving faster under lower levels, 
Or fueled by explosive residue ! 
But only mental health professionals. 

Too busy living under mortal rats, 
Not even having any breeding pair ! 
But there are only two domestic cats ! 
We know this life is ever very rare. 
[NEWLINE]
Not going back along that narrow range. 
Create a new transition zone between, 
Or wander through an open climate change ! 
My way to see the semi evergreen. 

With public members versus Mister chairman ! 
Or any very crowded avenue. 
We need so many dental medicine, 
For twenty thousand years of revenue. 
[NEWLINE]
Another million dollar corporation ! 
I wanna see their swinging upper floor ! 
They even know the local congregation, 
Is coming from an old department store. 

Each other people wanna introduce. 
But yet their inner senses stimulate, 
How many could no longer reproduce, 
This system hath designed to dominate. 
[NEWLINE]
Not one of those who dare manipulate ! 
The sake of human minds must educate ! 
Accept or stay correct or elevate ! 
Another move and then accelerate. 

Surrounded by columbus avenue ! 
And people wanna visit kansas city, 
With fifty hundred thousand mountain view. 
An ancient state of auto industry. 
[NEWLINE]
Would rather crumble under granite bay ! 
Or even stumble over inglewood, 
To never see another labor day ! 
I only need another neighborhood. 

This jam is going over jimmy walker ! 
So you can see my brother patrick j. 
Not even any sheriff coroner, 
Or something from his speaker henry clay. 
[NEWLINE]
I know what happened on abortion rights ! 
He had a very loyal opposition, 
But also blinded by the southern whites, 
An english mayor versus richard nixon. 

Too busy sucking dirty wavy hair ! 
Their bodies covered under metal strips. 
So open onto any shoe repair, 
Or when this world is coming back to grips. 
[NEWLINE]
We only need another wooden comb !

A very pretty little steering wheel. 

Is covered under muddy mountain fountains ! 
These candles burn with flaming wooden beams ! 
This tangled pile of heavy rugged mountains, 
Are slowly flowing through cathedral streams. 
[NEWLINE]
And mystic orange velvet purple pear. 
That early evening morning lightning strikes ! 
My body like an icy winter bare, 
Or seven wishes over flower spikes. 

Human systematic observation ! 
They wanna read their spiritual teachings, 
Or wander through a social isolation, 
With hidden feelings from symbolic meanings. 
[NEWLINE]
An open minds against the poorer nations. 
But there is only vital comprehension ! 
Depending on my conscious expectations ! 
Has given me a media attention. 

But you are only being brought ashore ! 
Too many people orient themselves. 
And at my own entire ocean floor, 
This very shiny continental shelves. 
[NEWLINE]
No million hundred thousand valley floors ! 
An old exclusive economic zone, 
Not going under any rocky shores, 
Or nothing like a tropical cyclone. 

Or write my own bilingual dictionary. 
Who cares about what you already proving, 
This nation needs replacement therapy ! 
We need a party going on removing.

And there is only really necessary, 
The facts are never gonna calculate ! 
So many problems being done correctly !

The human body over poison ivy. 

Surrounded by an occupation actor !

I know this dirty little motor freight, 
Is coming from the dairy industry ! 
We need another way to activate. 
His name was really gene delivery. 

They never really know what you are wearing ! 
Not even very ever runny nose. 
No cure for any human stomach glaring, 
Or something flowing through my fingers toes. 
[NEWLINE]
And then another nasal cavity, 
Which one is only human motion capture ! 
Or such an animal anatomy ! 
Its coming back to me expressing anger. 

Are people going under pryor creek ! 
Not reading miller brewing company, 
Each day i see another losing streak, 
Humans at police and benny hee.

Designed to perish like an ocean spray.

Fifty billion children celebrating ! 
For only one republican convention.

Or seven hundred million teams competing. 
And like a thousand minutes from december, 
To know about a local office meeting. 

This one is getting you preoccupied ! 
For giving me another love affair ! 
I heard how many friends have even tried, 
To stay a little longer unaware. 
[NEWLINE]
I know my very own potential threat. 
And putting on an old cocaine addiction, 
An only dream of having never met, 
Or ever gonna die without suspicion.

To rule the world with massive laser guidance. 

Who needs so many decent lawyers doctors ! 
We never knew what people could afford. 
I wanna know how many trading partners, 
Are getting punished by its own reward.

Perhaps the lowest unemployment rate ! 
Is also based upon the only lesser, 
For any other way to elevate ! 
A massive action from a tourist sector. 

Against this modern planet solar panel ! 
Each passing day upon remote location, 
Is heading at another narrow angle ! 
A hundred thousand dollar preparation.

My mother knew an only friend of bobby, 
Forgot the funny thing about her father. 

It really matter dear hello hello ! 
How many flowers under cover art. 
Not selling any english radio, 
For twenty fifty thousand albums chart. 
[NEWLINE]
But maybe only whether richard berry, 
Or ever even educated guess ! 
They never see another elvis presley, 
Surrounded by a very huge success. 

Another big enormous kitchen garden ! 
Not even easy sucking pretty polly. 
Its funny acting awful dirty rotten, 
This world is very happy feeling jolly. 
[NEWLINE]
No one has ever really melted butter, 
Are you too busy making toxic ham ! 
For being any human fortune hunter, 
Or putting on a chicken noodle spam. 

Has even gotta rusty stamp collecting ! 
No one can see how many daniel chester, 
Who ever had his little finger bearing ! 
He wanted something like an ancient sender. 
[NEWLINE]
We never asked for any autograph. 
But when my life was dealt with stainless steel, 
To paint upon an open photograph ! 
I could deliver from an iron seal. 

Is king of absolutely necessary ! 
This pretty little giant knights commander, 
That may eliminate unnecessary. 
An equal resident ambassador. 
[NEWLINE]
To worship at my very own command, 
And float together like a golden kite ! 
Not being under second fatherland, 
Or never even any roman rite. 

Too many people running through de carlo ! 
But then it also took delivery, 
For me to offer you my patron motto ! 
This wizard alice Mister richard billie. 
[NEWLINE]
His room with uncle peter super vee. 
He offers me another engine cruiser, 
Or any lincoln motor company, 
I need a very little mini cooper. 

My own entire core vocabulary ! 
But when these dreams become an imitation ! 
And there is nothing better ordinary, 
Than any visual hallucination. 
[NEWLINE]
Which way to post apocalyptic fiction, 
A million billion situations where ! 
No one can see an instant repetition ! 
So many simple words extremely rare. 

Who could become the longest serving member ! 
Or maybe even something mobster b. 
Some way of getting ready Mister bearer, 
To know this world is only one degree. 
[NEWLINE]
No need for any human semi trailer ! 
Can you afford the maximum amount ! 
I wanna see another puppet maker, 
An extra dollar from my bank account. 

Not even having any reflex sight ! 
My mind is really something multi user. 
I like this modern planet satellite, 
Or one entire world without computer. 
[NEWLINE]
A nation under total enterprise, 
And only human beings being agile ! 
So many other people utilize ! 
An endless space between the solar panel. 

Have twenty years of older generations. 
But yet they only wanna criticize ! 
The truth about these stupid conversations, 
And those who really might apologise. 
[NEWLINE]
A little simple language isolate, 
Or maybe having any conversation ! 
I know we could continue on debate ! 
Another world without communication. 

A couple hundred thousand tires sagging, 
Or fifty hundred million dollar bill ! 
And there so many rivers running slashing ! 
For something you can never even fill. 
[NEWLINE]
I gotta feel my middle finger dropping, 
About to move an extra double tighter. 
Its kinda like a little trouble chopping ! 
I really wanna see a color timer. 

Too many people going devastating, 
Who cares about this stunning victory ! 
But one is only human being waging ! 
Who needs political stability. 
[NEWLINE]
A nation from an indian rebellion ! 
Another great aggressive policy, 
With any other public intervention ! 
We wanna join the mercenary army. 

Without receiving social intervention. 
A loss of human senses drinking water, 
My thoughts become affected by correction ! 
I study like an image lasting longer. 
[NEWLINE]
I wanna suffer at severe depression, 
Or being under primal therapy ! 
Who needs protection from disease progression ! 
My carnal mind remains unnecessary. 

Remember when they could no longer teasing. 
As one for any older generation ! 
Was waiting on an early morning greeting, 
And happy couples making celebration. 
[NEWLINE]
I see a hundred million mothers swearing, 
To hear the little children sitting cheering ! 
Not even really going back expressing ! 
I never saw so many people kissing. 

But only ever human eyes are waving, 
I really need another celebration ! 
To wait for any modern day embracing ! 
Too many people standing by ovation. 
[NEWLINE]
Or parting from my loving memory. 
Is nothing like an endless carriage ride, 
A little love with white supremacy ! 
An open arms no longer glorified. 

Seven hundred thousand carat weight, 
How many seconds moving motion sensing ! 
No matter only one anticipate ! 
We may not wait for modern day comparing. 
[NEWLINE]
A never ending vertical position. 
To change direction under mass rotation, 
Or being stricken by advanced precision ! 
This world is such an easy combination. 

Entire world is calling jacob ben. 
This place so many feeling deeply shaken, 
As though it really pleases mari n ! 
They also need a peaceful demonstration. 
[NEWLINE]
To travel over tokyo japan, 
An island at an exhibition centre ! 
A thousand hundred million people jan ! 
We know the holy roman emperor. 

Their raging metal bloody boiling drain ! 
This very mighty river running molten ! 
And children walking through the maiden lane, 
With muddy water eating white corrosion. 
[NEWLINE]
They know that dirty rotten iron pillar, 
Is telling me how many people forge ! 
I wanna see another copper silver, 
A hundred million dollar cheddar gorge. 

That bloody early morning sun arising ! 
This day the only thing concerns about, 
Is worth a billion people analyzing ! 
Until these other sides are pointed out. 
[NEWLINE]
They wanna see how many peter heather ! 
No way to use my own existence warming, 
For those who might have given such an error, 
Not having any evidence supporting. 

Or ever needed any second gallon ! 
For nothing like a million dollar buyer. 
So later on that giant station wagon, 
He could become his very own provider. 
[NEWLINE]
Too busy being taken by demand, 
And going back to watch their blood entwine ! 
The one who only thought about my brand ! 
They handed me another warning sign. 

And under second string manipulation ! 
They had amazing cosmic blues progression, 
For such an endless total degradation ! 
This world was very only gene expression. 
[NEWLINE]
To see another level drastically ! 
As any other body could unwind. 
It sounded like an ancient cherry valley, 
Designed or dazzled by the strings that bind. 

About how many people motor racer ! 
Are you so very little multi core, 
That love is such an undefined behavior ! 
This world revolves around the backing store. 
[NEWLINE]
For something like anonymous e mail, 
To living life without a session bean. 
No teacher ever offers me email, 
Or any other way of being gene. 

Who needs a very little north dakota ! 
Some folks are going back to indiana ! 
But there was really norman oklahoma, 
Or even western county alabama. 
[NEWLINE]
We bought louisiana mississippi, 
We never had too many wooden jails ! 
They walked across an island kansas city, 
Or seven hundred thousand yellow males. 

Too many may become completely willing ! 
They even gather at their own charade ! 
Some children offer unto others fearing, 
But there are only people getting paid. 
[NEWLINE]
So darling please receive an ancient plea, 
Prepare for glory you shall soon submit ! 
I hope no one can really guarantee ! 
Or any person on which you commit. 

Too many little people going lower ! 
And from an altered state of verbal humour. 
This woman needs an extra special folder, 
For any other human being super. 
[NEWLINE]
No one has given me another pre, 
To read my cellular biology ! 
How could it ever really matter z, 
With lower words and vocal harmony. 

Not gonna bother drinking roger milli. 
It really even matter doctor fate ! 
Or early morning gene delivery, 
Or maybe going through a floating gate. 
[NEWLINE]
I need another brother kevin j, 
An hour is coming over sarah connor ! 
My little sugar daddy alan kay ! 
Are you with me or Mister nancy farmer. 

Is when they really wanna feel disgraced, 
But only hearing voices pointing out ! 
A hundred billion people being traced, 
Too busy going home without no doubt. 
[NEWLINE]
Im gonna sing the greatest song of mardi ! 
Not asking any questions at no mention. 
How many other others dare to copy, 
Or even know my very own conception. 

Not wanna see my only chicken wing, 
That you have any other single stitch ! 
This guy is gonna feel his belly sting ! 
I know he really needs an extra itch. 
[NEWLINE]
No one can even wear another sweater ! 
Another stupid boxing federation, 
And nibble on an imitation leather ! 
Or maybe Mister david lynch foundation. 

This party going on banana pi ! 
Im gonna wear another onion garlic ! 
We travel at atlantic planet y, 
And then they really wanna order logic. 
[NEWLINE]
So many people from above equation, 
With any constellations listed by ! 
Or me my style is such a transformation ! 
We stay together like the delta chi. 

Too many people using limitations. 
Are you so busy playing norman chapel, 
Is simply only minor variations ! 
I never need another cocking handle. 
[NEWLINE]
Not like an independent rear suspension, 
Or under outer space without suggestions ! 
No way to use my very own extension ! 
Depending on the leading edge extensions. 

Alone together on this endless night, 
I need an angel watching over me ! 
No matter any weather wrong or right, 
Between the places where my eyes can see. 
[NEWLINE]
Is there a very special place for you. 
Wherever people gather round and go ! 
An awful little thing we gonna do ! 
Afraid of being old enough to know. 

My own entire european countries ! 
Is such a very big descending order, 
Being working over recent studies ! 
Im looking at an early morning caller. 
[NEWLINE]
This world created little population, 
Too many people had enough to share. 
I wonder where we could become an asian, 
Or maybe something really fairly rare. 

About an old exclusive interview. 
They had their own melinda gates foundation, 
For any beings like peru peru ! 
I hear no holy cross contamination. 
[NEWLINE]
Or dying on a private weather station, 
To see this life is highly classified, 
Without religious freedom restoration ! 
We never need another human guide. 

Another second praying indian, 
No one was there so many tribal members ! 
He had this very final disposition ! 
That you would rather play with tribal elders. 
[NEWLINE]
Who try to travel under oklahoma, 
And land but never ever spotted tail. 
An only northern island north dakota, 
A hundred billion people love for sale. 

Too many people playing old commission. 
Not gonna carry any irish sweater, 
And never even know his own position ! 
He needs another great distinguished lecture. 
[NEWLINE]
Or selling western hoover institution ! 
He gotta new entire ford foundation, 
A very tiny little student union, 
I really wanna see an invitation. 

Who thought that there was way too busy staying ! 
To see how many people had returned. 
A little story only devastating, 
What happens when no one is badly burned. 
[NEWLINE]
So follow me upon the baggage train ! 
Unlock my own chaotic situation, 
Or push it back again and then maintain ! 
I could recover from an empty hasten. 

I gotta little crazy mamma wow, 
My mama mommy baby daddy whoa. 
Oh Mister lovely lady stephen chow, 
Is such a funny little person cho. 
[NEWLINE]
An old idea going outta aye ! 
This guy was looking pretty really bad ! 
She had a very busy saying hi, 
For making me a part of being glad. 

Too busy talking over service packs ! 
Im going through my little mortgage debt, 
But then they offer me replay attacks ! 
I wanna play that modern jazz quartet. 
[NEWLINE]
How many people acting real unstable, 
Or catch another dictionary entry. 
And try to hide behind each other stable ! 
Are you the only one l hennessy. 

Who knew a pretty lovely lady mary ! 
And when she married edgar kennedy, 
Her dad was having such an awful penny ! 
We also wanted any captain harry. 
[NEWLINE]
They only ordered harry after ella, 
To marry eddie thomas benny baker ! 
The very younger cousin mrs. emma, 
His sister lady mother killed the waiter. 

Believe a sorry little sister alan. 
But you can see my cousin jesse frankie ! 
The only local tennis champion, 
Are coming from an english princess danny. 
[NEWLINE]
So sing this message over gary nancy ! 
And there is alice mrs. Mister mandy, 
Who cares about the pretty lady sadie ! 
I wanna marry Mister russian patty. 

Hanging from an empty rooted tree. 
But soon these seats are really gonna stack ! 
We never even open any v, 
Or ever hear another heart attack. 
[NEWLINE]
I know what other people might undo, 
For life has given me a witness stand ! 
This living room is full of partial mu, 
Too busy looking at my own command. 

Can you create another new domain ! 
Its greatest lack of mutual protection, 
And yet its only human chronic pain ! 
We add to any drug abuse prevention. 
[NEWLINE]
For such a big unstable situation ! 
Or on an eastern roman empire, 
With seven hundred string manipulation. 
I know how many souls are linked together. 

That tiny little single crucifix, 
Should ever march upon my final note ! 
The very greatest master mono mix ! 
Too many clever words can also quote. 
[NEWLINE]
And though it may not even mention sender, 
Or any title could obtain permission ! 
Perhaps a million dollar bill collector, 
Is part of such an excellent condition. 

Can tell each other others print hello, 
As though they know how many hovers over ! 
We gonna travel under second row ! 
Not going back against the latest folder. 
[NEWLINE]
I wear my own entire index finger, 
Behind my very little wooden tray. 
This world is really such an awful ticker ! 
So please or even try to crawl delay. 

With candle candles burning brightly loading ! 
She lays beneath my lovely little kite ! 
A gentle river flowing gently rolling, 
Her dizzy body beating very tight. 
[NEWLINE]
This tiny little liquid garden shakes ! 
That giant water fifty meters deep, 
Is drifting over stones of shallow lakes ! 
A hundred thousand million people creep. 

His very great enormous scarlet oak. 
He promised me the spanish empire, 
To london land and only cunning folk ! 
D la persona nelson rockefeller. 
[NEWLINE]
Un dios como este argentina, 
De sea en western christianity ! 
No esta una vida es el dia ! 
A little mississippi river valley. 

She never started dancing only teasing. 
Was ever really happy feeling pretty ! 
Not having any early morning keeping, 
Or yet so busy seeing something dingy. 
[NEWLINE]
And smiling looking lovely pretty breezy, 
But beauty causes such a strange delight ! 
To wander through an empty room uneasy ! 
Too many people wearing nothing quite. 

Not having never landed property. 
This little mother surely may have paid ! 
Its gift for any highest quality, 
To know which you can never stay repaid. 
[NEWLINE]
And there are many people getting wealthy, 
Or being taken at acceptance rate ! 
But when i ever had an ebony ! 
Would add a hundred thousand carat weight. 

Is like an ancient northern hemisphere, 
So many changes do not coincide ! 
It happens over million dollar gear, 
A hundred billion people multiplied. 
[NEWLINE]
For seconds while the other one decays ! 
A human mental space reaction rates ! 
I never focus on another phase ! 
Or water picking outta figure skates. 

Depending on how many fuzzy systems ! 
Are you another super new nintendo, 
I really ever wanted freddie williams, 
To see a shiny chevrolet camaro. 
[NEWLINE]
Too busy looking at electric co. 
My own entire motor company ! 
Is coming over human audio ! 
We gonna need an extra licence fee. 

Surrounded by distorted residential ! 
He hides behind an empty oven door. 
His eyes are looking at some other level, 
To see this very little wooden floor. 
[NEWLINE]
People climbing over those thick walls ! 
How many buildings under hollow ceiling, 
Or even any local market stalls ! 
But there is really only central heating. 

Another bullet from the armor plate ! 
Of forty billion bullets peel commission. 
Its like an automatic loaded weight, 
So high with heavy rifle ammunition. 
[NEWLINE]
I hope this world has never gotten thinner, 
Or any better outer atmosphere ! 
No matter where their heads are getting thicker ! 
Too many people getting less severe. 

Is only disney animated feature ! 
They wanna know how many golden pines, 
Was looking at apollo theater ! 
Who had electrical transmission lines. 
[NEWLINE]
Have heard about atlantic canada. 
To see no angels under outer banks, 
Or any other mobile alabama, 
The night we spent together having shanks. 

We had a modern statement terminator. 
This episodes executive producer ! 
The jerry lewis versus colin baker, 
So busy living at their own computer. 
[NEWLINE]
Too many people calling freddie jones, 
And playing music over string ensemble ! 
I know that you are only human clones ! 
And when they handed me detective novel. 

An only human life is mandatory ! 
No need for any other tax collection, 
Or public number one priority, 
Too many little russian fascist chairman. 
[NEWLINE]
My kids are grabbing at their sole official. 
I hope to see what you already lacked ! 
And you rely upon the principal ! 
A new religion never ever backed. 

Can you depend upon this simple phrase, 
The place that most attractive creature seeks ! 
No one for whom it really often pays, 
How many people having meaning speaks. 
[NEWLINE]
And then not speaking from an old profession. 
Perhaps a single word is simply merely ! 
Who may describe their very own expression, 
Without a sexual activity. 

Being taken twenty minutes shorter, 
And then become another liver kidney ! 
I feel this life is never lasting longer ! 
A biological activity. 
[NEWLINE]
No need for me to carry any weight ! 
Im holding onto something very rarely, 
Or looking at the only second rate ! 
I wanna know that nothing else can vary. 

And making children try to operate ! 
These shiny plastic boxes slightly longer, 
Their swinging fully loaded lighter weight, 
No matter where the crowds are getting shorter. 
[NEWLINE]
They scatter like an iron teddy bear ! 
We gotta travel over foreign ships. 
A seven hundred million dollar fare ! 
My heart attack with heavy metal whips. 

Can you remember Mister cricket ball ! 
He had this heavy iron folding fan, 
His way too busy playing basketball ! 
My little lady over sports sedan. 
[NEWLINE]
That pretty shiny purple racing jockey, 
Is like some sort of british touring car ! 
I need another land to roller hockey, 
Or offer me an empty steel guitar. 

Central coliseum theatre ! 
That early morning station whistle stop, 
My very own apollo theater. 
A song for those who ever stood atop. 
[NEWLINE]
No matter whether black or buffalo, 
But you remember uncle horace mann ! 
An island syndicated radio ! 
I never follow any weatherman.

To see an orange san diego zoo !

And children walking over river tees.

Is going back to staten island wee, 
Or where i could remember outward bound ! 
This lovely little southern ville marie. 

Is never ever gonna crawl delay, 
It when they really wanna session bean ! 
We know their very own convenient way ! 
The heavy java virtual machine. 
[NEWLINE]
That razor sharp descending chain condition, 
Each other human being beta testing. 
My body under pressure menu driven ! 
I need a little super grammar checking. 

We ever wanna even hula hoops ! 
I gotta super human folding blade, 
So busy running through electric loops ! 
Not working at my own consumer grade. 
[NEWLINE]
This very little giant dynamo. 
Or maybe love is never really real, 
But yet it only likes to move too slow ! 
An old piano on the daisy wheel. 

As though these words are often simply stating. 
They know how many questions rarely mentioned ! 
That there was only any one explaining, 
Who could become the very urban legend. 
[NEWLINE]
Being blinded by my own expression ! 
Not like a puppet on an empty string, 
This life is such an awful thing to mention, 
No love for anyone or anything. 

But there is nothing like that java me, 
These little people selling microphones. 
Not gonna wait for any monthly fee ! 
Its coming from so many mobile phones. 
[NEWLINE]
No way to use each other hearing aid, 
Or catch another signal generator ! 
We gotta travel through the latest trade ! 
They wanna label me an operator. 

She catches animation domination ! 
This giant leather upper yellow peril. 
With fifty million dollar aggravation, 
Or any operation pedestal. 
[NEWLINE]
So watch that carbon copy Mister hee, 
They wear his very handy turkey shoot ! 
He drives an orange nitty gritty g, 
He also likes a sugar substitute. 

Who really care about humility, 
Not gonna mention those almighty god ! 
We know they wanna marry you sincerely. 
But even though his name is tony todd. 
[NEWLINE]
And yet he gives no earthly hesitation, 
The way that thou forever meditate ! 
I hear a prayer for thine divine salvation, 
To worship at an open wicket gate. 

Resistance from abandoned perry mason, 
The ultimate responsibility. 
For those religious freedom restoration, 
Who ruling nation members versus billy. 
[NEWLINE]
Some people try to practice legal fees ! 
An equal opportunity commission ! 
We ordered any other common pleas ! 
I wanna see another split decision. 

Her little human body slowly spray. 
This party at another planet smash ! 
Each other sixty seconds blown away, 
To seven hundred thousand lightning flash. 
[NEWLINE]
Too many people going through thick smoke ! 
Or maybe something over dolly zoom, 
But there is nothing like a killer poke ! 
I know another one and only doom. 

Can you believe what those concerns about ! 
So many questions may remain untrue, 
For me to offer any little doubt, 
Surrounded by my very darkest view. 
[NEWLINE]
No human beings seeking god delusion. 
These words are true or passive observation ! 
The inner world is such a false conclusion ! 
How many people need consideration. 

We never had another union army ! 
Ah il un jour de lui et e lee. 
It started from columbus pas l marcy, 
My baby back to nashville tennessee. 
[NEWLINE]
Can you remember me and james monroe, 
So many stories under louisville ! 
An english russian william idaho ! 
An ancient story over chapel hill. 

Too many hungry people eating corn. 
Each one with only other evil eye, 
Who cares about that million dollar horn ! 
Who could have any old acquaintance pry. 
[NEWLINE]
No gracious Mister pretty lady trample ! 
Or you would rather meet my uncle jesse, 
And offer you another urine sample, 
For seven hundred years of royal dairy. 

Seven hundred million bodies raising, 
Too busy acting like an old reduced ! 
Not gonna wait until this day is fading ! 
Since there are people being introduced. 
[NEWLINE]
Each other one can barely stimulate. 
And when we need another human size, 
To stay together at a slower rate ! 
No matter where the waters steady rise. 

Upon this very final landing strip ! 
Is there no other engine going flying, 
Or riding on another rocket ship ! 
Im moving forward from direction finding. 
[NEWLINE]
For any supersonic passenger, 
Or ever gonna catch an atom missile ! 
Its coming crashing like a delta dagger ! 
They never know about the squadron signal. 

I carry seven thousand blocks away ! 
We travel through electric audio, 
And also music versus double jay ! 
A modern age recording studio. 
[NEWLINE]
This group is simply getting very indie, 
For you to hear the sound of constant touring. 
Its only entertainment industry ! 
And maybe number one began rehearsing. 

Their lovely shiny yellow horses laying. 
She spoke with naked lips whose eyes were glaring, 
That night but then her fingers started quaking ! 
And even though his heart was gently shedding. 
[NEWLINE]
Upon this very silent evening grass ! 
He wondered where so many people bare, 
To wander through an empty tinted glass ! 
I see my pretty little shaggy hair. 

Would never ever question you no mention, 
Or loving questions during speculation ! 
What happens when the sexual selection, 
Has simply given me no indication. 
[NEWLINE]
It causes subtle minor variations ! 
We thought we had a very big connection ! 
Who cares about competing explanations, 
That there is nothing like an old perception. 

That sexy little lady emily ! 
She needs to know a woman named rebecca, 
Is crying over bobby mary betty ! 
Not any pretty auntie cinderella. 
[NEWLINE]
No never ever sorry teddy jenny ! 
Another lonely lover only ratty, 
Aloha mama mia linda peggy ! 
Oh hurry home forever valerie. 

Entire world without equality ! 
This little nation under human nature, 
Is killing me against psychology ! 
Supposed to deal with criminal behavior. 
[NEWLINE]
No person ever could become sarcastic, 
Or even read about discrimination ! 
I only need another moral panic, 
Created by my very own persuasion. 

Or travel after motorola inc. 
To catch an early morning silver screen. 
Each day another tiny little sync, 
Has risen from an angry fax machine. 
[NEWLINE]
A billion tons of heavy metal stocks, 
Are slowly turning under fax machines ! 
A world surrounded by precision clocks ! 
Can see a hundred thousand movie screens. 

But there is nothing better by peru, 
Than any western persian calendar, 
Or million dollar military coup ! 
No matter where it crashes shortly after. 
[NEWLINE]
This money coming over ninety billion ! 
Who sends an arrow running through japan ! 
Destroying our united nations mission, 
To join the germans at afghanistan. 

That there was nothing yet already shown. 
For only hearing voices slowly wailing, 
And offer me another precious stone ! 
It started feeling like no longer naming. 
[NEWLINE]
My very final chapter does appear, 
Each verse or any minor character ! 
But when we see a little thing unclear, 
I hear an ancient story hardly ever. 

As looking at an absolute beginner, 
For me to join my own entire journal ! 
Who thought it might have gotten any sicker ! 
This one is very jewish virtual. 
[NEWLINE]
And even jerry wonder mister k, 
We gonna know about nebraska lincoln ! 
Can you remember really mary j, 
The only second story princeton princeton. 

To outer land of foreign domination ! 
I see that silver yellow mountain chain ! 
This tiny little boxing federation, 
Is lying under boiling water main. 
[NEWLINE]
Or falling over south america, 
Its slowly sinking under river drains. 
A billion people passing through sahara, 
Another hundred thousand mountain chains. 

Not even reaching any alpha channel, 
That you would never ever feel the same, 
To see some very local western panel ! 
This world revolves around my stocking frame. 
[NEWLINE]
No answers at the human front suspension, 
For any rather Mister polar wander ! 
Or stumble on an easy blues progression, 
Or waken me computer monitor. 

Too busy being doing nothing right, 
We gotta wait a little second see, 
Or something from another lonely night ! 
Was there an angel watching over me. 
[NEWLINE]
The one that you can hardly even know ! 
No one who cares about what people say ! 
So many crazy ways of letting go, 
Without believing such an easy way. 

To any country upper eastern side, 
Or two or even fifty quarter strand. 
With twenty seven silver meters wide, 
My very mighty little lexus brand. 
[NEWLINE]
But you have seen so many capitol ! 
They follow me along that grassy hill ! 
We travel from an old cathedral chapel, 
Another hundred thousand pebble mill. 

Or something from the local hampton inn ! 
Who ever bought a nike missile base ! 
About how many others lie within, 
This world has given me an open space. 
[NEWLINE]
To wear my very own marine reserve, 
That there are only people planting trees ! 
It may not even matter by preserve ! 
I know it never pays admission fees. 

Modern serving kindergarten through, 
But when we gotta double laser cutting ! 
They know how many other people ku ! 
Im glad to see a brother doing something. 
[NEWLINE]
For me too busy eating reggie fu, 
And charlie wilson versus johnny z. 
My dad was living like a captain vu ! 
He never had another quarter ki. 

Not even g escape velocity, 
And join my very own momentum frame. 
This cloud is flowing over malted barley ! 
No people ever gonna feel the same. 
[NEWLINE]
So busy looking at jurassic z ! 
I may have given you another distance, 
To see a hundred thousand units si, 
The better days are going on for instance. 

Another nation under alan kay ! 
Too many people at computer screens, 
A very simple video display, 
No love for any real or session beans.

Passing billion angles scattering, 
Or like an island at bodega bay.

Not cause we gotta deal without creating, 
How many other people sided dice. 
No second chances at excessive saving. 
[NEWLINE]
So lets create another situation, 
And see the only one potential threat ! 
But there is such a constant expectation ! 
To change an image from an empty set.

He bought a very special business partner, 
With janet jackson santa walter randy ! 
An early morning Mister thomas roger. 
[NEWLINE]
And doctor robert Mister richard miller, 
Not even going back to lois lane ! 
No matter david king or ronald fisher !

Or larry lewis versus david arnold. 

So very busy making audio. 
And then an early morning party taped, 
It may not even any breakfast show ! 
But when this number one is getting scraped. 
[NEWLINE]
Who really cares about an hour ago, 
Without a single instrumental piece ! 
Too many people on my radio ! 
They only bother giving me release. 

And wait for any daily motor freight, 
To see this party going bona dea, 
The way we really do not hesitate ! 
Un dia una casa esta ee.

Or write a digital photography.

And by so many practical advice, 
People on my way to dublin core. 
A million hundred thousand loaded dice, 
Are only coming from the trading floor. 

Seven scottish parliament election, 
And fifty billion lords select committee. 
We need some dirty little rum rebellion ! 
Too many people going through to sydney. 
[NEWLINE]
I wanna see this stolen generation, 
Who really needs another labor party ! 
Not even need a motor corporation, 
Or any virtual monopoly. 

An open iron scarlet water root ! 
This christmas day another child has grown. 
Their bodies boiling over olive fruit, 
But then they know that rotten seeds are sown. 
[NEWLINE]
And mother nature eating golden peas, 
Beneath the only human cattle feed ! 
We float together under maple trees ! 
No way to plant a very little seed. 

This new entire world destroyer tender ! 
A million bodies leaking classified. 
Their children where committee ends december, 
They sing about my little sister clyde. 
[NEWLINE]
So many people under north atlantic, 
With muddy water trading companies ! 
But lord have mercy like an irish catholic ! 
And mountains over sea surrounding seas. 

Not even moving facial animation, 
Or looking at electric satellite. 
He finds an open orbit inclination, 
To burn with neon candles burning bright. 
[NEWLINE]
And then another summer moon europa, 
Is covered under wine and pontiac ! 
As winter night descends upon corona, 
Or feasting on an ancient mission pack. 

Their own entire persian alphabet, 
Is going under any carbon copy ! 
My only little secret internet.

Or going under solar water heaters ! 
My stomach fueled by electric pans. 

Their own entire giant melting snow. 
Not yet too busy eating human soil ! 
We need a hundred billion rivers flow, 
Water flowing over diesel oil. 
[NEWLINE]
A little money under cattle feed ! 
This great environmental degradation, 
Has given me an alligator weed ! 
Is measured by the power generation. 

And see that life is very clever though. 
They might already know their human rights, 
Are grown too busy acting like a pro ! 
No matter whether black or southern whites. 
[NEWLINE]
How many guys have ever felt expressed ! 
I never wanted any one of those, 
So many actions had become addressed, 
A social system from which you oppose. 

Too many fully loaded rolling dice ! 
Which one who cares about my entrance fee ! 
I know this world has such an awful price, 
For something like another spelling bee. 
[NEWLINE]
Can you remember me without regard ! 
That very little staten island ferry, 
Or when we could afford a credit card, 
It never really needs an extra penny. 

Is making music by a mega lo. 
Some folks not even reading magazines ! 
Or write a very simple audio, 
Who likes to play with those arcade machines. 
[NEWLINE]
So many people over tokyo, 
Their little children selling sushi rice ! 
They gotta join the pirate radio ! 
We only need a fifty ticket price. 

Another early morning tracking shots ! 
They need an instant facial animation, 
To deal with laser beams and plastic plots ! 
No room for any second generation. 
[NEWLINE]
Or maybe having even landed gentry. 
Or children walking under blinking lights ! 
But there is only very little many, 
People laughing at the southern whites. 

I wanna tell my baby cousin terry, 
To see what happened on that kinda lean ! 
An extra message over Mister perry ! 
They know how many words were torn between.

Or though i never knew an old professor, 
Was there to marry harry stephen crane.

Who likes to use the slightest comprehension. 
[NEWLINE]
I wanna hear this little tractor pulling ! 
It offers me a disney studio ! 
So you can see how many people learning, 
Or even any other audio. 

For only seven hundred years too late ! 
That you would never ever go ashore. 
And those who may not even know my fate, 
Was never reaching any other shore. 
[NEWLINE]
They followed me a cosmic castaway, 
To travel through an endless traffic raid ! 
Another day the captain sailed away ! 
I started feeling like a renegade. 

Who ever wanted any salary ! 
He had another private enterprise. 
This very little garment factory, 
With children running over food supplies. 
[NEWLINE]
To laugh about their only self employed, 
And water from an endless bitter strike ! 
They know the other kids are unemployed ! 
But there is nothing like a flower spike. 

I might have waited on my own request, 
To know what may this poor acquaintance stay ! 
His friends were looking at remote arrest ! 
And from the very day he walked away. 
[NEWLINE]
Who knew how many women could persuade, 
Or later on that old hotel backseat ! 
They only had a little contra aid, 
So full of love no one would ever meet. 

Are gonna practice at their own convention ! 
How many people try to dominate, 
With such a very little intervention, 
A social human mind eliminate. 
[NEWLINE]
Is there no cure for profit corporations ! 
Destroy this world of fascist italy ! 
And never ever really close relations, 
Or even join the public armed committee. 

Not even busy selling three supplies, 
But there was only laughing when i rode. 
And though they bother me with prying eyes, 
So many lonely people may unload. 
[NEWLINE]
The little children wear a bloody nose ! 
These rainy days are never gonna stay ! 
Forever under second prices rose, 
Or ever gonna die for christmas day. 

They wanna listen mister uncle ben. 
Have mercy goodness gracious bad email !

A random form of java javascript ! 
And putting freedom on the message boards ! 
An answer never ever really zipped.

Or getting hot and newly organized. 

For lovers under rosy mistletoe, 
Too busy walking through banana trees ! 
We had this very golden ratio ! 
So fond of pretty girls and honey bees. 
[NEWLINE]
Are never ever having any fashion, 
Or dazzled by a crimson blossom petal ! 
An only second number one medallion ! 
Another secondary sexual. 

With distant faces looking awful scary ! 
A hundred thousand voices underneath. 
Their gentle quiet silence strangely heady, 
And echoes from so many worlds beneath. 
[NEWLINE]
No way to hear this very magic theme ! 
Is something ever really creamy white, 
And either laugh or sigh or even scream ! 
What happened on another stormy night. 

A million people focused heavily. 
Have mercy on this very great depression ! 
For those enormous popularity, 
Who suffer from political oppression. 
[NEWLINE]
Not only any quarter century, 
To work against political unrest ! 
We know the greatest lasting legacy, 
Is simply also equal interest. 

We carry on with such a pressing need, 
I feel this love is making me maintain. 
My mother saw the other day proceed, 
To move as though she could no longer gain. 
[NEWLINE]
Not even really being carried out ! 
So many people cut a little wider. 
What any hell were you concerned about ! 
I knew that there was only one entire.

Is living life without manipulation ! 
No mental chemical contamination. 
To use a systematic observation, 
A most experimental demonstration. 
[NEWLINE]
Being high and lethal concentration, 
Putting humans under food supply ! 
Not like the only human drake equation ! 
That never ever could identify. 

We never ever really even wann ! 
El mundo entre una pena blanca ! 
I feel another world descend upon, 
Around the corner watching ev estrada.

They play with simple lyrics by beretta.

And something from the experts recommend, 
For any very second heart disease, 
Created by another downward trend.

Or being leaning on a human blubber. 

How many people dare not hesitate ! 
Oh please accept this social disposition ! 
I wanna private senses designate, 
And see my own potential clear distinction. 
[NEWLINE]
So add another little declaration, 
For any sole solution unto thee ! 
A human being by an obligation ! 
The only thing that matters unto me. 

And see how many people multiplied, 
Or like exactly any other z ! 
As though it may not even coincide ! 
What may become a very major g.

Too many living on an empty tomb ! 
O little sinner enters thomas nelson. 
[NEWLINE]
A very faithful savior unto thee, 
Who hears this message ye united brethren !

Some yellow velvet shiny silver plaque, 
And from that pretty little pizza shop ! 
My very little london city shack ! 
With seven hundred million years atop.

No one to visit any old motel. 
We only need another ocean floor, 
Or something like an empty sands hotel ! 
So many songs about the local lore. 

Not even any other debbie harry, 
Can ever see another silver plate ! 
This shiny lovely pretty yellow dairy ! 
That purple velvet roses decorate. 
[NEWLINE]
So very busy drinking cotton candy, 
Or buying flowers from the market stalls. 
No one to offer me an empty baggy, 
A million little boys and shopping malls. 

Not being driven by survival rate. 
My mind revolves around delivering, 
But you can hardly even concentrate ! 
Was there too many people neatly drilling.

We really had a little public training ! 
I never wanna see dramatic change ! 
As soon as you continue concentrating, 
And scratching at an open wider range. 

His number seven hundred years of cheating. 
I wanna see my greatest fortune teller !

But then i see another wolverine ! 
Surrounded by the horror science fiction. 

Too many very little teacher training !

For fifty thousand single seater racing, 
Till early morning after graduation. 
[NEWLINE]
Or public number one consent decree ! 
And there is simply such a teaching tool ! 
To know what happened on the fourth degree ! 
Their parents never really magnet school. 

Not having any mutual submission.

For home and then the room begins to grit.

Too busy looking at electric steel, 
With on an extra carbon microphone, 
This system under solid steering wheel ! 
Who waits for any mobile telephone. 
[NEWLINE]
I never rather stumble over hoops ! 
To use my very little multi layer, 
And pockets full of heavy metal loops ! 
So follow me behind a vacuum chamber. 

To suffer human beings from providing. 
So many organs had become designed ! 
An altered state of artificial lighting, 
This planet where no one became refined. 
[NEWLINE]
A hundred thousand bodies turnaround, 
And blinded by a little picture slowed ! 
An open body slowly gaining ground ! 
Another legend never ever showed. 

As any person putting children under, 
A major lady at the royal womb. 
So settle back relax and do not stutter ! 
No matter where a human mind consume. 
[NEWLINE]
For being very highly flexible, 
Too many people under toilet training ! 
They never even see enough parental ! 
Depending on another muscle wasting. 

To carry under those remaining ties ! 
I guess i know exactly where its leading. 
And though it often merely compromise, 
Is there not ever any longer keeping. 
[NEWLINE]
Too many people having old esteem, 
Human blood appointed governor ! 
The world was forced to join a new regime, 
A broken life divided by another. 

Not gonna wait another day ecstatic. 
But looking at my senses getting numbing, 
For any moment from an instant classic ! 
Some people know that there is something stunning. 
[NEWLINE]
A way to carry on forever daring, 
No matter whether moving back or praising ! 
They never ever really feel depressing, 
No one can hear an ancient trumpet playing. 

Their very own domestic policy. 
But there are really nothing guaranteed ! 
How may some people trade monopoly, 
And kill for love until no one was freed. 
[NEWLINE]
What could have given me this royal charter ! 
Has such a serious consideration, 
Being taught to use a little honour ! 
We only need an equal obligation. 

Surrounded by this great united state ! 
No one controls his heritage foundation. 
Not even human being regulate, 
Or going through an ancient job creation. 
[NEWLINE]
I know that there are only foreign nations, 
To see how many other people voting ! 
Have mercy on the younger generations ! 
Another nation under coca growing. 

Too many people going on commission. 
This little economic policy, 
They never wanted any opposition ! 
He only had a continental army. 
[NEWLINE]
I wonder william henry harrison ! 
Is threatened by his very own election, 
The nation under thomas jefferson ! 
No one has risen from a ruling session. 

Not giving you another worthless crumb, 
For when i really needed Mister cheesy ! 
To see my mother started playing dumb ! 
She thought his name was absolutely cheeky.

He had an english spoken dialogue ! 
Too busy having something most fantastic, 
And acting like a little shaggy dog, 
That never ever felt so very tragic. 

Created by a little stripper clips ! 
We need another proper aggravation. 
To work for having sex with inner lips, 
And yet a human mental mutilation. 
[NEWLINE]
Its only secondary sexual, 
Not any sexual activity ! 
This world is very highly flexible ! 
They wanna know about the liver kidney. 

Until my mother finally replied, 
Each other night another brother came ! 
His father had become unsatisfied ! 
A very little hero soon became. 
[NEWLINE]
And then an evening after day began, 
He knew what any second life was taking. 
But then the early morning children ran ! 
Not going back to where they started staying. 

Their very little economic bubble ! 
We had become an ancient dungeon master, 
To places where the only logic puzzle ! 
Is coming from a classic traveller. 
[NEWLINE]
An urban life without expansion packs, 
Rap or ever thought about what happens, 
This feeling like a magical attacks ! 
No space for razor blades and chain reactions. 

Children at their very own duet ! 
Is making love with silver synthesizer. 
They write about that funky old quartet, 
And sing together singing gospel choir.

Are people playing band electric drummer, 
Not gonna play the music getting played ! 
So nice to see my uncle stevie wonder ! 
I wanna hear another serenade. 

For any great complete determination, 
Most atomic energy commission ! 
This endless systematic observation, 
Is driven by so many gifted children.

A mental terrorist activity. 

Total military reservation ! 
For only one division champions ! 
His own entire union corporation, 
Is fueled by artillery battalions.

And there were never really headed north, 
Or ever walked another eddie plank.

Was coming from an empty heavy tank. 

My middle finger under copper silver ! 
No need for any higher quality, 
Can you maintain another molten mixture ! 
Create an ocean full of malted barley. 
[NEWLINE]
I really wanna hear electric co. 
This one is only getting introduced ! 
Who needs an animation studio, 
To see the new entire world produced. 

Can you remember something recreation, 
Or tell how many people gonna thrive ! 
But yet this world is only human haven ! 
What happens when the visitors arrive. 
[NEWLINE]
We never know about my pleasure craft. 
To see this rusty old commercial fishing, 
For any very little tuna raft ! 
Another million tourists visiting. 

Not knowing any second realization, 
For giving me uncertainty about ! 
Are you i know my own annihilation, 
But when i ever wanna cancel out. 
[NEWLINE]
The greatest mind is only taking place ! 
Has wasted life upon a human bubble. 
Have taken freedom from an empty space, 
That never could create this logic puzzle. 

It follows me across atlantic border ! 
Who waits for any very grassy plain ! 
No matter when this world has gotten smaller, 
And yet so many other rivers drain. 
[NEWLINE]
We only need another small location ! 
To see an open lower stratosphere. 
Surrounded by a lowest elevation, 
That you have had enough of being near. 

Wherever everybody wanna go. 
Who cares how many other lovers do, 
But nothing else we could already know ! 
As though my heart was waiting there for you. 
[NEWLINE]
And never coming back another day, 
A place that you can hardly even see ! 
Or ever gonna hear what people say, 
Is like an angel watching over me. 

Another super british opera diva, 
And Mister louis comfort tiffany ! 
I wonder little baby mamma mia, 
Has me too busy drinking austin mini. 
[NEWLINE]
How many people feel unwanted g ! 
My future passes under ruby laser ! 
What happens when the major double c, 
Is captured by a giant auto racer. 

Not ever gonna mention tennessee ! 
Are you prepared for any leader title, 
A hundred thousand triple zero three ! 
Each one together like professor micheal. 
[NEWLINE]
No matter where committee ends december, 
Or even at the longest serving mayor ! 
We know he needs another top contender, 
To fill an empty execution chamber. 

How happy precious winter moments go ! 
We may not even care what lovers do ! 
This little baby may already know, 
That something else was waiting there for you. 
[NEWLINE]
But then an angel stole my heart away. 
We could have had it any other way, 
Has never ever seen the light of day, 
A million ways so many words can say. 

Their parents better blame themselves for taking ! 
They wanna know about an old decision, 
But you can hear another statement saying ! 
A big decision after indecision.

Too busy living life without a failing, 
Or even try to carry on believing ! 
We started playing music at the blaming. 

What kinda pretty little guy that tries, 
Are really very funky super duper ! 
Who cares for any other one replies ! 
To add another public social user. 
[NEWLINE]
My father may become an ordinary, 
But when it ever offers me connection ! 
Or such a new performance penalty ! 
So many people better pay attention. 

As any other planet meets beholder ! 
Who likes to see his very own disguise ! 
But watching mother nature hovers over, 
People floating under scarlet skies. 
[NEWLINE]
And gazing at this little magic mirror, 
Whose face appears upon the movie screen ! 
No one has ever seen an angel shimmer ! 
Or maybe there was only michael sheen. 

Not any animal anatomy ! 
So please can you remove my amplifier, 
For such a very greedy little fatty ! 
And threaten me with sexual desire. 
[NEWLINE]

I never even thought metabolism ! 
And social cellular biology, 
Are looking at the latest mechanism. 

Defeated by eternal fear creates ! 
They feel their very own pathetic might. 
It happens when this inner soul awaits, 
To learn as any person catches sight.

How many other people might reveal ! 
Not even like an evil human brains ! 
No way i know what you believe is real.

A thing that no-one could appreciate.

Each day the world was only getting very, 
Too many people going on behaving ! 
But when this party started going fairly ! 
It sounded like an old piano playing. 

Or even care what others may create. 
But then for those who could provide assistance ! 
No one is only gonna regulate, 
We gotta stay forever driving distance. 
[NEWLINE]
With me and watch this little world expand ! 
I wanna see another knowledge sharing, 
A lotta rappers better understand !

Or going through another population ! 
With fingers over modern constellations, 
My mind is such an easy combination. 
[NEWLINE]
Too busy counting numbers after four, 
This very special channel rated t ! 
I followed sixty seconds slightly more, 
To cut each other like a tonic key. 

A hundred thousand million dollar fees,

Too many people paying guilty pleas,

To see my little lady looking down ! 
An early evening morning finds its dwelling.

And on an eastern giant river valley. 
[NEWLINE]
Collecting wishes over rolling hills, 
That very lovely little basic needs ! 
A human being under sugar mills ! 
It only happens when the cattle breeds. 

Another generation simply prays ! 
An image helps each other others find, 
And finds a better life unless it pays. 
But there is nothing you can hide behind. 
[NEWLINE]
So watch as you begin to realize ! 
How many people having social treats, 
Who really cares or even mother tries, 
Or taking care of everyone she meets. 

A hundred thousand billion people stew ! 
So many couples making massive mills, 
San francisco cincinnati zoo ! 
Have me surrounded by surrounding hills. 
[NEWLINE]
With water from my little fishing gear ! 
Is slowly moving over northern pike, 
And swimming under giant eagles mere. 
I climb the highest valley mountain bike. 

That rusty arrow kindergarten through ! 
No matter where this silver meteor, 
Is going through milwaukee avenue ! 
Not even know another parent teacher. 
[NEWLINE]
He offers me an old revolving loan. 
Can hardly wait for any day or west, 
To see what happens when my heart has grown ! 
So many diamonds under hazel crest. 

Not only one too busy being charter ! 
My very own executive committee. 
We watch each other closely monitor, 
This criminal responsibility. 
[NEWLINE]
Can you executive authority ! 
Is there another county tax collector, 
Or write or play it really mandatory ! 
A million ways to kill an old offender. 

Twenty seven hundred thousand stabs ! 
To hide their only true identity, 
Who dare not matter any person grabs, 
Or even helping other people flee. 
[NEWLINE]
They never thought he could redeem himself. 
So many changes cause no one agrees ! 
And then a broken heart disguised herself, 
Until i know that nothing really frees. 

They know no one is coming from sofia ! 
So join this operation joint endeavor ! 
And die an island under costa rica ! 
We may become a roman emperor. 
[NEWLINE]
I could create an open skies agreement, 
To see the dirty south arabian, 
But you are only human captains regent, 
My inner mental self determination. 

A thousand years of total degradation. 
Too many people at their own condition ! 
We may not care about contamination, 
Or one with only weapons ammunition. 
[NEWLINE]
But yet so very often cause severe ! 
Who sits upon this little cabin floor, 
To bury me within my steering gear, 
And though i never ever could restore. 

Have mercy on an evil human mind, 
For giving you a question intuition ! 
I guess this one is only really kind ! 
It ought to know the social definition. 
[NEWLINE]
Who ever thought about divine salvation, 
Or those that could destroy themselves opposed ! 
So many others way against creation ! 
Not having any other problem posed. 

A group too busy being tore apart, 
My ladies getting ready steady go. 
This jam is gonna party going start ! 
What else we ever really wanna know. 
[NEWLINE]
The latest club recording studio, 
Not playing at recording studios ! 
Or passing through another movie show ! 
An early morning over counting crows. 

Too busy having privacy protection, 
We gonna use a holding penalty ! 
Who cares about no medical profession, 
Or any new replacement therapy. 
[NEWLINE]
But there is nothing like a followed suit ! 
Are you the only one disease prevention ! 
I need another sugar substitute, 
For me to offer you my sole discretion. 

Too busy being social billionaire. 
The little kids begin to testify, 
And then become another millionaire ! 
But even though they never really spy. 
[NEWLINE]
How many other people might expose, 
Who could have mercy under roger warner ! 
Or at a major marvel studios ! 
We need an only number one reporter. 

Was slowly looking forward secrecy ! 
But then another day dispute arose, 
This precious little life no longer needy ! 
I need so many highs and freezing lows. 
[NEWLINE]
These words are only getting any stronger ! 
To use my finger on an atom holder, 
Or at the very second larry walker, 
For making me too busy being polar. 

They slither onto crystal symmetry ! 
Their ghastly liquid body slowly grows, 
With mass electrical activity, 
Or countless bodies under frozen rows. 
[NEWLINE]
Or human fluid organs clot formation ! 
Are feeding on an empty nervous system. 
Surrounded by another combination, 
Behind this lifeless cell metabolism. 

He catches busy drinking early forties. 
His mind contains extended vocal section, 
And form a hundred thousand comic stories ! 
The most entire mystical dimension. 
[NEWLINE]
Is ruling mathematical foundations. 
This creature causes mass expansion pack, 
To travel under social revelations ! 
Await the birth of death and paperback. 



My own entire world remains unclear ! 
I know that you no longer dare deny. 
But when this final moment doth appear, 
We fail to see another great reply. 
[NEWLINE]
The people where familiar thoughts reflect, 
A random form of genesis creation ! 
How many words perhaps remain correct ! 
What may not yet exist without relation. 

A super hero john anita patty ! 
My lady anna Mister warren ellis. 
His voice is calling tony peter stanley, 
With robert thomas david drummer dennis. 
[NEWLINE]
Oh bobby baby sister cousin terry, 
Another party on the russian heather ! 
No talking over harry george or jerry ! 
We gonna offer you a new professor. 

Recover from my eyes completely slight ! 
What happens when these walls become so dense. 
And only nothing ever going quite, 
Are there no matter any further hence. 
[NEWLINE]
Not having any inner isolation ! 
How many other people might succumb ! 
But when this crazy little situation, 
Is such an easy way to overcome. 

To see another wooden berry picking, 
Not even playing soccer basketball ! 
Too many people running skinny dipping ! 
Are walking under highest waterfall. 
[NEWLINE]
This purple winter summer summertime, 
An empty pocket full of tennis swimming. 
It only happens when the mountains climb ! 
And maybe you become a little fishing. 

Is also clever by expressed concern, 
For those who only likes to smuggle weapons ! 
No matter action versus Mister stern ! 
Some people never even need suggestions. 
[NEWLINE]
Or when the hollywood reporter stated. 
A hundred billion triple brady handy, 
Have given me an extra letter dated, 
One entire counter battery. 

We ever even need defense attorney, 
For freedom under criminal offense ! 
Or use the very moral certainty ! 
But nothing causes any common sense. 
[NEWLINE]
So many people had a great conviction. 
And those no longer lessons yet confessed ! 
My heart has risen from an old decision, 
To travel through another state arrest. 

Or even care for profit corporations, 
I wanna know how many passive labor ! 
For massive masses under civil nations, 
Each other members like the western mayor. 
[NEWLINE]
A thousand billion lyrics by l marcy. 
Another new machine and license plates ! 
A representative democracy, 
To stay together on united states. 

Not gonna wait for any partial shade, 
This town has never ever staple crops ! 
Are coming from another toxic trade ! 
Their bodies covered by banana hops. 
[NEWLINE]
Its water boiling over winter wheat. 
Or even under outer mass starvation, 
Too busy being eating human meat, 
To fill the world with solar radiation. 

Was looking at each other interviews ! 
They started learning very moral lessons. 
We had a message on an evening news, 
No longer writing any new suggestions. 
[NEWLINE]
How could we ever gonna motivate, 
Is really something real creative thinking ! 
Or even gotta learn to demonstrate, 
What you already kept delivering. 

An extra fully automatic pistol, 
Too many people being levi p ! 
We only gotta little ticker symbol, 
Million dollar parent company. 
[NEWLINE]
Are you or any other feral cattle ! 
Its coming from the doctor engine holder. 
My mind is getting heavy cocking handle ! 
Im finding something like a prison owner. 

As fire with tiny candles silvery, 
We know they only had another goo. 
No one has never ever felt so itchy ! 
This evening gleaming misty winter blue. 
[NEWLINE]
A hundred thousand colors burning bright, 
And yellow like an endless darker shade ! 
A very lovely crimson shining light, 
My purple velvet shiny silver suede. 

Not even any other draws attention. 
Have mercy on another daily texan, 
For being number one convicted felon ! 
This ten percent descent american. 
[NEWLINE]
Is like an old reverse discrimination ! 
I know it only needs enough email, 
To care about melinda gates foundation, 
They never ever wanna send e mail. 

Other people wearing easy prey. 
They never knew what no-one could become, 
Or nothing ever gonna fade away ! 
It started like an arrow coming from. 
[NEWLINE]
This world is waiting on its final turn ! 
No turning back to those whose hands are sweeping, 
Abandoned by the one that you return ! 
A broken weary soul was only keeping. 

Human system may eliminate. 
Some people feel so very busy waiting ! 
The one who really might anticipate, 
Or hardly ever thought about creating. 
[NEWLINE]
How many other systems you create ! 
Are never yet designed specifically, 
For such an easy way to calculate ! 
Eternal life is only getting risky. 

Would you remember being model checking ! 
She thought he had another pigeon pea, 
But any wonder giant roller bearing ! 
This little spider web of java ee. 
[NEWLINE]
I wanna see an angel stalking horse ! 
Whose name i truly know that ami pro, 
Was only captured by an open source. 
So many ways to change the audio. 

Not gonna wonder where they started heading, 
Too busy doing any old request ! 
Or though we hardly even stopped expecting ! 
An early morning cardiac arrest. 
[NEWLINE]
A little mama barely kindly lied, 
For me to hear another statement saying ! 
What happened when my only friend replied, 
I never really thought about awaiting. 

Would flow across this very wavy line ! 
To see how many other sided die ! 
They know that distant mountain may align, 
Upon an island under western sky. 
[NEWLINE]
So many horizontal axis shows. 
Its only one another solar sailing ! 
Surrounded by an ancient compass rose, 
Is moving at a thousand upward facing. 

That plastic tape machine is slightly thicker ! 
This simple system needs an extra stitch. 
No need to carry any other zipper, 
With seven hundred thousand dollar switch. 
[NEWLINE]
We only gotta bottom service pack, 
Or sixty seconds over second dot ! 
My middle finger on the kitchen rack, 
Another bullet through another knot. 

They might consider suicide prevention, 
But please remember jerry springer show ! 
Not giving only media attention. 
I know it happened many months ago. 
[NEWLINE]
To see this global heritage foundation ! 
Is nothing like no other session bean, 
Or any second trophy presentation ! 
Another silly little magazine. 

People under permanent display. 
Or travel through too many wealthy patron ! 
They know how soon that happy labor day, 
Is due for any human presentation. 
[NEWLINE]
Each day another moment brings together, 
And join this very little small cafe ! 
Have given me an exhibition centre ! 
My own entire nation triple j. 

Or ever even test facility ! 
He gotta million plastic coffee makers, 
To add another drug delivery, 
For fifty hundred catastrophic failures. 
[NEWLINE]
With iron power only muscle strains ! 
We know this dirty little pressure vessel, 
Is lying under broken window panes ! 
An empty belly full of molten metal. 

Not gonna care about what love provides, 
And freedom from this musical addition. 
Is nothing like a giant carriage rides ! 
It carries lots of talent competition. 
[NEWLINE]
Who needs an extra very special guest ! 
To wait for any human recreation, 
Or wander through electric music fest, 
With laser beams and highest concentration. 

Their own entire human mind is splitting ! 
This soul can only simply rearrange. 
My thoughts are moving on a pre existing, 
For those who thought would never ever change. 
[NEWLINE]
A hundred thousand creatures joined together ! 
No one to tear each other worlds apart ! 
And then i feel abandoned altogether ! 
A newly risen from the delta dart. 

Not gonna wait another day bahama ! 
And looking at that dusty old debris. 
Is slowly sinking under pillow lava, 
We know his very own admission fee. 
[NEWLINE]
He only had so many dollars drilling, 
For you to see some microscopic crystals ! 
I wonder whether even garbage picking, 
Or travel through an endless sea of nickles. 

Religious leaders making big decision ! 
They stay too busy fighting on protecting, 
And then accept a powerful position ! 
But human minds are only worth defending. 
[NEWLINE]
We know so many people criticize, 
No use against their very own protector. 
Not yet defeated by an exercise, 
Or any other one and great defender. 

Being under social motivation ! 
Is coming from this very private sector ! 
Can ever study any preservation, 
Or even mother nature brings together. 
[NEWLINE]
A hundred thousand waters profit sharing, 
I know how many levels lag behind ! 
Its hot and rapidly developing, 
We wont allow another thing designed. 

That tiny little purple garden peas, 
Has never really any clover seed ! 
Or maybe dancing over maple trees ! 
Not even drinking alligator weed. 
[NEWLINE]
We struggle from a most apparel sector ! 
Too very busy eating plastic rice. 
No matter whether under cooler weather, 
Or fully laden by the market price. 

Their shiny yellow colored merchandise. 
Who cares about translation memory ! 
They know this old commercial enterprise, 
Are gonna feel a little user friendly. 
[NEWLINE]
We really need another market share ! 
Not even any local market stalls, 
Is something coming from an open air ! 
Of sirens echo through the banquet halls. 

Attention any questions may translate, 
No use depending on my motivation ! 
To see another world anticipate ! 
I really need an easy conversation. 
[NEWLINE]
A simple word that you can visualize ! 
Is where we either learn or then react ! 
Some other children also socialize, 
And yet an others only interact. 

Created by their own athletic shoe. 
They gotta very fully melting chrome ! 
Its only heavy solid residue, 
Not even any southern island foam. 
[NEWLINE]
Is laughing at the local choir stalls, 
And children selling money over plastic ! 
No hundred million people climbing walls, 
Or yellow flowers under woven fabric. 

Being over little richard gott, 
That purple plastic body radiation ! 
What happens when my life is getting hot ! 
Its giving me an ocean circulation. 
[NEWLINE]
I really need another downward pressure, 
To know no matter where the tension thickens. 
It never changes under cloudy weather, 
Or even having any wet conditions. 

Another happy sovereign lord provides ! 
It finds its way for me to occupy, 
And learn these lessons from my heart divides. 
Too many people do not qualify. 
[NEWLINE]
Have any little part of egypt jordan ! 
I wanna see the highest concentration ! 
This one is such a very tiny portion, 
That you create an inner population. 

This very quiet little horror writer. 
Im gonna wrap my head around sofia, 
To see another holocaust survivor ! 
A hundred thousand people sipping pina. 
[NEWLINE]
I feel surrounded by an outward symbol, 
Being written under brian greene ! 
Not even Mister jewish mystical ! 
But there is only any human bein. 

Not gonna die for darryl david jason. 
And where their righteous souls are very jolly, 
This place no one awaiting restoration ! 
So many children rot velocity. 
[NEWLINE]
With money on an extra million yen ! 
D double r a continental t, 
Wherever there is also gary n, 
Or jerry lewis versus simon dee. 

Too busy making poster advertising, 
Not looking at this very broken heart ! 
Are you so many people most exciting, 
No answers under any album chart. 
[NEWLINE]
For those who try to read the latest news ! 
What happens when it offers me release ! 
I never thought of positive reviews, 
But there is only one companion piece. 

Who likes their own entire envelope, 
With one too many oral medication ! 
They only really wanna microscope ! 
No matter simply sample preparation. 
[NEWLINE]
As soon as you await the final test, 
I try to add another second tools. 
And nothing ever could results suggest ! 
My thoughts become unstable molecules. 

Too many people playing pryor creek ! 
As soon as you can see this semi pro, 
We gonna catch another hitting streak ! 
Its coming from an early rodeo. 
[NEWLINE]
They wanna murder me louie louie. 
Have money from the local tennis courts, 
And back to salem public library ! 
I need an empty pocket full of sports. 

That could create an endless barren land ! 
A state of modern beings humankind. 
We use their powers by each other hand, 
And join this very little human mind. 
[NEWLINE]
Which way to travel under waning moon, 
Or where no one is looking at affect ! 
The people on a malibu lagoon ! 
Are guided by an ancient intellect. 

Too busy living under high regard, 
Looking at the problems you create ! 
I know this world is really very hard ! 
But those no longer yet eliminate. 
[NEWLINE]
We know how many years have gotten fewer, 
For such a new performance penalty ! 
As though not even human being newer, 
Or ever thought that could become a very. 

But only Mister pepper carries freight. 
I could remember georgia buffalo, 
That lovely southern texas interstate ! 
The northern lincoln county idaho. 
[NEWLINE]
And rikers island over central maine, 
For boston from miami on savannah ! 
A little kansas city st. lorraine ! 
I travel through an image indiana. 

Behind my final channel drilling holes, 
It offers me another comfort shrine ! 
We need so many empty plastic bowls, 
This city life is really very fine.

No freedom under second color filler ! 
An iron tower over pagan temple ! 
The only one who could become a pillar ! 
Remove the surface from an ancient pebble. 

The triumph over tokyo japan !

For Mister max and mrs. thomas mann, 
It from an amateur athletic union.

With seven hundred thousand brothers dying ! 
To tell how many rivers run aground, 
Who really needs another last surviving.

Too busy living on an angry crew ! 
We see so many bodies thrown aboard, 
Are getting eaten by the spanish flu, 
A million people going overboard. 

A biological activity ! 
We wanna battle you with gene expression, 
And then assume responsibility ! 
To face another day without prevention. 
[NEWLINE]
No place to wander through an altered state, 
The world is moving on severe restrictions. 
Its like remote control and regulate ! 
Or use control or negative opinions. 

Her kisses gently rises under wraps ! 
I feel that gentle velvet river flows ! 
And then upon a raging river slaps ! 
She touches me until the water slows. 
[NEWLINE]
She whispers softly like an aching gaze, 
I fade away but nothing ever heals. 
Another lonely broken city lays, 
Familiar places where my heart reveals. 

Have ever given final second date ! 
We see an equal error incorrect ! 
This hidden press can also calculate ! 
A very simple thing that you expect. 
[NEWLINE]
I travel open lines are often proven, 
Not even other people may succeed. 
My own design for one ideal solution ! 
No need to gaze upon the highest speed. 

Not even human living pure creation. 
And mother nature needs divine salvation, 
For neither mortal savior nor temptation ! 
But there is such an evil inclination. 
[NEWLINE]
Who ever hath become a true believer, 
Or dwell upon an evil great reward ! 
Salvation unto me apostle peter ! 
No one to worship at my own accord.

That pretty little plastic coffee maker, 
For making money over public debt.

And running from the local sub committee. 

Are falling deeper under flavor texture ! 
It also add another vocal fold, 
Or maybe there is really something fresher ! 
This world designed to form a foreign mould. 
[NEWLINE]
With shiny yellow candy coated paper, 
We move together like an alpha blending. 
The masses gather at their own thick layer, 
They never even thought about depending. 

A hundred million dollar buick motor, 
So many digital photography, 
This year is there another organ donor ! 
Some people getting money from atari.

A way to use my own email account, 
Or any other little liquor stores. 

Remember me not necessarily ! 
Each day i gotta spend some time consuming, 
But there is nothing gonna happen any !

For any little self identified ! 
An english city black and bloody asian, 
Entire human owner occupied. 

Not having life no longer barely lasting,

Or such a little mother nature chatting ! 
I know this world is absent altogether. 
[NEWLINE]
For those who could appear to vary greatly, 
As though the water started flowing nightly. 
It had become an empty garden mainly ! 
We often talked about variety. 

Or care about what others imitate, 
And mother nature needs appreciation ! 
But people never even meditate, 
Their own entire inner meditation. 
[NEWLINE]
Some questions suffer cosmic realization. 
No answers under any comprehension ! 
The world is only human motivation ! 
Each social vision could become perfection. 

This party at a temporary measure ! 
Who thought they might have had enough dominion, 
To see what ever happened by september !

That you remember life is mandatory ! 
And when the glory days are unified. 

Surrounded by discriminate between,

But most of those entire context switching, 
Are using reproduced without permission ! 
A hundred thousand million voices clicking.

To see what happened over martyrs day, 
My little brother father damien ! 
He had another public holiday. 

Enough to meet an old professor paul. 
I know my brother maybe sara lee, 
But there is only going way too tall ! 
This pretty little target shooter b. 
[NEWLINE]
We gotta play another peter merk, 
For those who wanna see the poor mccoy ! 
Too busy acting like a captain kirk ! 
Remember mister david benny roy. 

No matter traffic weather wrong or right ! 
So many angels watching over me, 
No one escaping from this endless night ! 
With open eyes an eye can plainly see. 
[NEWLINE]
Not like a human being real and true, 
The only thing another person do. 
Too many changes coming after you, 
Or nothing ever gonna follow through. 

A fully loaded weapon luger pistol ! 
No one surrounded by the armor plate, 
They only need another deadly missile. 
So many people running outta weight. 
[NEWLINE]
We never even gotta open bolt, 
My itchy trigger finger blasting caps ! 
Im gonna kill another funky colt ! 
Or try to handle any booby traps. 

A single moment you anticipate, 
I feel my senses simply contemplate. 
These thoughts are making me appreciate ! 
The one that others merely imitate. 
[NEWLINE]
Some people also educate themselves ! 
Not really yet so very busy seeing, 
This world is going on familiar selves ! 
I try to see another reasoning. 

Some funny pretty sexy poodle snacks ! 
He likes it over gimme peter noone ! 
That monkey sipping lemon water wax, 
Or something super mickey mouse cartoon. 
[NEWLINE]
What lovely chicken sucking lollipop ! 
An orange jelly belly jelly bean. 
My baby sugar cherry candy shop, 
So very happy christmas halloween. 

Water polished yellow silver copper, 
To jingle bells with scarlet lilies dipped. 
Whose royal vision lifted slightly darker ! 
That frosty roman serpent sweetly stripped. 
[NEWLINE]
A very crimson spider melted down ! 
And hid his precious little colored glass, 
Was strangled by the golden iron crown ! 
He never wore an iron double brass. 

Another hundred million sleeping quarters. 
To see how many other pilots fly ! 
They gotta travel by religious orders, 
Or having such a very short supply. 
[NEWLINE]
Their daily business causes user fees, 
I really wanna super fire brigade ! 
To use the richest members overseas ! 
A most entire human tourist trade. 

An english mississippi river levee. 
I wanna hear that mighty city drain ! 
No rivers coming over mountains ferry, 
To any very difficult terrain. 
[NEWLINE]
And there is only one ambitious plan ! 
Or river under rocky mountain winding, 
With seven hundred thousand bridges span, 
Too many little southern trucks are piling. 

Who sits upon an open district court. 
He owns his own entire civic pride ! 
This world is only living on resort, 
To even know wherever you reside. 
[NEWLINE]
A hundred thousand million dollar owner, 
Another military reservation ! 
A dirty tiny little body holder ! 
My name was taken from an early haven. 

How many people try to java me. 
We simply gotta deal with plastic macs, 
And fifty million dollar company ! 
For such a pretty little tenor sax. 
[NEWLINE]
No matter any latest weather channel, 
Or on this new edition java ee ! 
We never really pin compatible, 
But please consider me consent decree. 

My only number one creative suite ! 
We gonna add some funky audio ! 
They really wanna marry Mister tweet, 
And play that little jerry springer show. 
[NEWLINE]
Are you too busy selling cindy sherman, 
For making me an answering machine ! 
I bought a very instrumental version, 
Or any person on the movie screen. 

Can you remember singing howard baker ! 
That very big ohio river valley. 
Is there too many people from decatur, 
Who hang with billy brown or hanky panky. 
[NEWLINE]
Not even michael jackson jacksonville ! 
We never bought an english boston garden ! 
His name was headed over texas hill, 
To see my little brother eric carmen. 

No matter where these chicken heads are drying ! 
I gotta forty thousand gallons per. 
Too busy making artificial lighting, 
And taking over Mister douglas fir. 
[NEWLINE]
Im sitting on an open rubber tree ! 
This one was never ever really dumping, 
Or moving fast or even sara lee, 
Is like a super rubber motor pumping. 

Would order any other danny ferry, 
And add another video replay ! 
No one can you remember bobbie gentry ! 
That spooky little lady rudy gay. 
[NEWLINE]
His head was very busy playing soccer, 
Or reading letters after penny taylor. 
With larry davis versus tony parker, 
Who never even saw the youngest player. 

Who dug this very little wooden floor. 
Each hundred million people hide behind, 
So many people standing by the door ! 
No shelter from an empty window lined. 
[NEWLINE]
I know that something else is gonna trample ! 
But there was only number one backseat, 
Or never ever really needed cattle, 
Or even stumbled onto fifty feet. 

Not gonna see another hash collision, 
Or where it only needs another maxi, 
And then we gotta nicotine addiction ! 
For those who never had an old cat fancy. 
[NEWLINE]
They need a little felony conviction, 
How many people wanna send e mail. 
Can you remember me with your permission ! 
I try to use my very own email. 

Not even any other person bugging, 
Or care what you expect a deadly weapon ! 
I guess this one is gonna die disgusting ! 
It only ended when they had no mention. 
[NEWLINE]
The judge was really young or being blamed, 
For those who never dared to disrespect, 
An endless narrow minded victims claimed ! 
Another massive error incorrect. 

Is falling crashing over carbon chains, 
It sends a virus mixed metabolism. 
Its only sticky heavy metal strains ! 
Are coming from this very solar system. 
[NEWLINE]
Not even really eating pollen grain, 
Or boiling water causing acid clot ! 
Im being followed by the daily strain, 
That you have never had enough to rot. 

Who owns a nation through formaldehyde ! 
They try to use an empty license fees, 
But also very carefully supplied. 
Some people from convenience companies. 
[NEWLINE]
The only way to spend my duty free ! 
This world is only human circulation ! 
Another million dollar company, 
For any second market penetration. 

Escaping from an endless cloudy sky. 
This modern night equator satellite, 
Is getting busy eating beta pi ! 
Its only seven candles shining bright. 
[NEWLINE]
Each nation under such apparent motion ! 
I feel an instant radiation pressure ! 
I see another planet burning molten, 
Or blinded by the cosmic dust detector. 

Not ever getting any better plex, 
Or see this pretty little pizza chain ! 
Its gonna pop another yellow hex ! 
My life is like an automatic gain. 
[NEWLINE]
Im on a million dollar corporation, 
I gotta travel through my safest city. 
They label me karate federation, 
About the ghetto pah activity. 

Another global supersonic flight ! 
Or any other signal generator, 
To number one electric satellite, 
Or gonna catch another razor laser. 
[NEWLINE]
My nation under cosmic radiation ! 
They wanna battle me magnetic mirror ! 
This song with satellite communication, 
A billion lyrics by an ancient ringer. 

Not ever gonna question anything ! 
Not knowing any matters necessary ! 
I wanna see what only life can bring ! 
An other words must necessarily. 
[NEWLINE]
They might agree or any may apply ! 
The truth is neither fiction nor uncover ! 
So many people try to satisfy, 
A human being guided by another. 

Not even bother drinking cindy sherman. 
Or join my latest social presentation, 
And play this very sega saturn version ! 
It only offers motion compensation. 
[NEWLINE]
Is there no need for any other ticker, 
Or number one another fax machine ! 
Consider me the most disgusting sticker ! 
Some people hide behind an open screen. 

Or travel under second title track ! 
No turning back remember santa s ! 
I thought we had a little crazy knack, 
To spend another day without success. 
[NEWLINE]
And looking at my very highest charting, 
They could have given me an armour plate, 
But never seen too many people dropping ! 
It sounded like an album going straight. 

To know but there are never gonna leave ! 
No one can only dare assume command ! 
Not going any further from relieve, 
Or even thought it had already planned. 
[NEWLINE]
A hundred thousand minutes taken ill, 
They waited over twenty years too late ! 
So many days ago delayed until, 
Another day began to circulate. 

Too many dollar dollars random measures, 
Or ten percent decision making body ! 
Its only mass production council members ! 
A new entire public policy. 
[NEWLINE]
Is also based upon statistics nuts, 
Who needs no other sort of foreign aid. 
A hundred billion thousand budget cuts, 
To try and use another foreign trade. 

Entire body causes stomach pain, 
Friction by electric color vision. 
And from the very greedy rotting brain ! 
Become chaotic sexual affliction. 
[NEWLINE]
I wanna feel my medical condition, 
Erotic senses causing aggravation ! 
I wanna use this nicotine addiction ! 
Remote control and social isolation. 

Not giving any other function f, 
Too many people feeling very low ! 
But there are only seven treble clef ! 
So you can see another world below. 
[NEWLINE]
And gazing at an endless rising tone, 
I feel my heart is full of freezing lows, 
Within my very own transition zone ! 
No matter where this bitter river flows. 

Become surrounded by atlantic highlands ! 
As any eastern water runs aground. 
But only very many channel islands, 
Or nothing like another jersey pound. 
[NEWLINE]
No matter where not even goofy disney, 
We rollin over orange leather colla ! 
This heavy garrison artillery ! 
That southern north dakota south dakota. 

Such an inner mind reflected light ! 
It helps the solar system activate ! 
They know how many other guys excite ! 
Some people could completely penetrate. 
[NEWLINE]
A thousand other words and then transmit, 
This message from my very own device. 
I really wanna drink a little bit, 
Or never ever gonna feel precise. 

For any other merry christmas filler ! 
We started drinking orange pepper paste, 
My mother drank a little chocolate liquor ! 
He had acquired such an awful waste. 
[NEWLINE]
Being dazzled by the malted grain, 
But you have never ever felt so pure ! 
This song has given me an open vein, 
To never hear another sound mature. 

Knowledge where their inner organs fairly, 
Are causing great chaotic dominate. 
This whole entire world is secondary ! 
Some people try to carry heavy weight. 
[NEWLINE]
My thoughts become an only error mixing ! 
So many ways without consideration ! 
No greater angles any longer twisting, 
And driven by the chemical equation. 

Too many people feeling ultra high. 
This wicked little soul messiah jesus, 
That most amazing afro samurai ! 
What you not really such an evil genius. 
[NEWLINE]
I never need another cosmic freak, 
Or worship any evil ultra low ! 
And though i may discover something sleek, 
Upon a very holy scorpio. 

And then become another human hobby. 
I wanna see it getting easier ! 
To use a little higher quality, 
That nothing ever ventured nothing cheaper. 
[NEWLINE]
An extra mind designed specifically, 
For making you the only one consumer ! 
This dirty little cottage industry ! 
Are digging from my personal computer. 

A hundred thousand million secret joys ! 
So many fingers on her fingertips. 
No longer holding onto greater poise, 
Than one with any other finger tips. 
[NEWLINE]
I even know that lovely golden glow ! 
Is nothing like a permanent vacation ! 
Or maybe really something hot to throw, 
Or bother showing me about elation. 

D una mano amore petit il, 
Di luna bella via santa mar ! 
Some quiet english central centre ville, 
Or play another classical guitar. 
[NEWLINE]
Its april evening over san miguel, 
A river shining on a lily pond ! 
But when the world is running parallel, 
And esta vida alla por el monde. 

Not any very only tallest tower ! 
The world entire human motor show, 
Is like an island under solar power, 
No limit people over tokyo. 
[NEWLINE]
Are you united nations secretary ! 
To move together by another international atomic energy, 
And add a universal declaration. 
This one is coming from the pride parade ! 

Surrounded by so many trojan women, 
Who wanna travel under savage reader ! 
No one with only very simple diction ! 
That early evening standard theatre. 
[NEWLINE]
Or Mister davis versus dover wilson, 
Or overwhelming popularity. 
We never really need an old tradition, 
For me to see my little sister carrie. 

It could have given me a new duet. 
But way too busy having roger sessions ! 
He carries playing saxophone quartet, 
And singing any old piano lessons. 
[NEWLINE]
Are heading at an only composition, 
No matter where this band is being played ! 
The number one professional musician, 
We never wanna see no hit parade. 

Another working dollar billionaire. 
And at this very splendid isolation, 
Or having any losing market share ! 
He owns an old piano corporation. 
[NEWLINE]
Is there too many people buying selling ! 
For giving me the largest trading partner ! 
I know that you can never profit sharing, 
And only sleeping under betty carter. 

As you remember david clarence kelly. 
They bought a very friendly corporation ! 
Who asked for any other salem ferry, 
Was followed by awaiting restoration. 
[NEWLINE]
Each day and then another city clerk, 
He saw an army coming over sue ! 
I thought i had so many paperwork, 
My greatest job is only overdue. 

Remember Mister lennon harrison ! 
This place is there so many children flipping, 
Or going through an empty prison section, 
No matter where these little kids are clicking. 
[NEWLINE]
Their own entire nation overlapping ! 
Not even other people could delete. 
They know the use of being busy stacking, 
And having you around with fifty feet. 

Are you not even going home kathleen, 
Too many people talking bout kristina ! 
My baby daddy married norma jean, 
We had a very happy wife maria. 
[NEWLINE]
My little sister kato japanese, 
No one was ever gonna meet her mother ! 
An only number seven wife louise, 
I really wanna see an older brother. 

Their tender neon stars are burning bright. 
She sits and though it only catches thunder, 
Or when his love is nearly outta sight ! 
Her hair has never gotten any rougher. 
[NEWLINE]
No other woman needs another flare, 
That bothers me so you can hardly bide ! 
The very pretty little crimson glare ! 
Extremely easily identified. 

With overall responsibility, 
Or something slowly getting over ju. 
An ancient engine took delivery, 
And then an early morning pilots flew. 
[NEWLINE]
But there is nothing like electric lightning ! 
I need to feel my very own command ! 
I really wanna dream about providing, 
And see the only way we never planned. 

With english junior davis versus danny ! 
Not even taking care of bobby jesse. 
His mother only wanted uncle sammy, 
And john was really sorry billy wendy. 
[NEWLINE]
But then he had an extra trigger happy, 
To kiss my pretty little sweaty betty ! 
The robert thomas harry donald patty ! 
I wanna see the mister jesse freddie. 

A global mental moral obligation ! 
I gotta trade another wide selection, 
For peace and unemployment compensation. 
No answers when we need to use prevention. 
[NEWLINE]
The great entire government prescription, 
This total visual communication ! 
Is such an only alcohol addiction ! 
Too many people from an old foundation. 

Than any other question ever stated ! 
Not even having something fascinating. 
And though it very most appreciated, 
That any simple thoughts are merely stating. 
[NEWLINE]
Perhaps we really need a little praise, 
Or simply such an absolute perfection ! 
I may depend upon so many ways, 
To know the greatest gift of great conception. 

Is going under any final fold ! 
These little kids are gonna stay unwound ! 
They wanna battle over vegas gold, 
For sake of being Mister newly crowned. 
[NEWLINE]
My father only needs another session. 
No one can you afford an image coat ! 
How many other people need election, 
Or those who really wanted me to vote. 

An only fifty million dollar gator ! 
But also Mister peter pumpkin ming. 
I gotta crazy giant dragon slayer, 
That sounds so busy singing ali ding. 
[NEWLINE]
Or such a mighty jungle dungeon master, 
Too many people starring jackie chan ! 
My little power sonic master blaster ! 
The very most amazing spider man. 

Is nothing like a heavy labour party ! 
We gotta travel countryside alliance ! 
Some people drinking water quality, 
They know it only needs another licence. 
[NEWLINE]
To use an empty auto racing teams, 
The city under social deprivation ! 
Are wearing paper suits with pension schemes, 
And causes unemployment compensation. 

El gran camino para guillotine ! 
En este era nada mucho trois, 
O dios pero ella esta green. 
Un poco mas mirada para la. 
[NEWLINE]
An esta hasta cada clover hill ! 
No saber como viva la bouquet ! 
En una vida entre centre ville, 
Un dia una luna sur el rey. 

Another lonely nazi party rally ! 
These lovely pretty children hanging scrolls ! 
They picture any wedding canopy, 
Or like an island under totem poles. 
[NEWLINE]
I know that there are only patron saints. 
Some people offer me designer drawers, 
To see how many other evening paints, 
My fingers naked through the windows doors. 

Extremely very highly classified. 
And yet a certain group of feral children, 
Who also truly love their tourist guide ! 
They may not even offer your permission. 
[NEWLINE]
But there are people having preservation ! 
We know that any other declaration ! 
Is written by the sacred congregation, 
Or when no one became disinformation. 

Not gonna carry any extra weight, 
Water coming over running rails ! 
Atomic body better levitate ! 
Electric engine beating faster sails. 
[NEWLINE]
No turning pressure making me adjust, 
My senses spinning under acid steam ! 
Another tiny little forward thrust, 
Is slowly flowing through my tractor beam. 

His father also finds another goal, 
He only needs a little consolation, 
No one are gonna play this active role ! 
Im calling Mister david lynch foundation. 
[NEWLINE]
They really wanna know my youngest member ! 
The very holy senior secondary, 
Who try to handle even less than stellar ! 
I need a working number danny ferry. 

To wonder where this amateur musician, 
Is gonna kill another secretary ! 
I really need another politician, 
Or even pray for Mister missionary. 
[NEWLINE]
Not either homeless son or any preacher. 
No matter mister teacher leading scholar ! 
It only carries on religious leader ! 
I never play an actor like a farmer. 

Its heavy balance on a sliding scale ! 
She often thought he could obtain permission, 
But then his open body shoots for sale ! 
My mind arrives with criminal conviction. 
[NEWLINE]
Reading from a very big prescription. 
I wonder when that giant pilots fly, 
Is something like an under glass transition ! 
Are you the only one to qualify. 

Children walking over open air. 
They know this empty city never floats, 
No place for any local market square ! 
So many people under sailing boats. 
[NEWLINE]
That lovely shiny burning beauty pageant ! 
Each night another motorcycle rally ! 
And even though i see an old enchantment, 
Are waiting at the very grand finale. 

We know this very lovely pretty dandy ! 
Who thought that chicken polish non aggression, 
Is where they gotta really sticky panty ! 
Not even busy sucking fair complexion. 
[NEWLINE]
With only one mysterious affair. 
She never wore an orange leather vest, 
Or any water under rubber wear ! 
I need to catch another baby dressed. 

Not having any other people trading ! 
Some people never add another copper ! 
To work a large amount of cattle raising, 
With fifty million dollar trading partner. 
[NEWLINE]
No matter whether under sunny weather, 
Or yet too busy eating toxic freight ! 
Their very own entire private sector, 
A ruling urban unemployment rate. 

No mama ever needed intercourse ! 
He offered any holy matrimony, 
Or something from a woman named divorce ! 
With such an endless marriage ceremony. 
[NEWLINE]
The lady kept herself preoccupied. 
Her parents felt confused and torn between, 
To see how many other people died, 
She never thought about his wife maureen. 

Christina casa linda donna stella. 
De louis la lorenzo lauren jackson ! 
Was on the corner looking at rebecca, 
And singing over andy anderson. 
[NEWLINE]
Oh mommy calling tony david cheri ! 
This morning Mister betty Mister katie ! 
An english lady after eric bentley, 
She needs a little mona lisa jamie. 

Entire nation under massive mere, 
But soon their eyes are slowly running nerdy ! 
We only see whose name is Mister sheer ! 
I try to handle human controversy. 
[NEWLINE]
And when my mental thoughts become extreme. 
They sing about a very special blend ! 
No one created any rap regime, 
Who ever seen a never ending trend. 

A hundred thousand billion souls aligned, 
So many other words are truly real ! 
As pure as nature lines appear defined, 
Upon the very most extreme ideal. 
[NEWLINE]
This dream or under second voltage gain ! 
This world is such an easy combination. 
It slips away and dreams become mundane ! 
An empty vision finds a new salvation. 

So very highly busy charting single. 
Not gonna party at the studio ! 
And show how many people joni mitchell, 
A hundred million dollar cameo. 
[NEWLINE]
No second rock or any jazz quartet, 
Or even really care about percussion ! 
My name is only number one duet ! 
My body needs an orange purple onion. 

Not like the second price stability. 
So strange how many people formulate, 
To see a little creativity ! 
What any other person could create. 
[NEWLINE]
But there is something very most subjective ! 
No world has ever seen a new conception, 
Being taken by my main objective, 
And offers me a logical extension. 

Not even needed any monologue, 
For such a never ending love affair. 
But then each second spoken dialogue, 
Is like an empty glass of fred astaire. 
[NEWLINE]
This year was really very busy writing ! 
Remember when they saw my ruby ruby, 
He washed my eyes and picture me reciting, 
I had to write a new reunion movie. 

His pistol started slowly pulling out. 
He really thought no one was barely shutting, 
But no-one heard their dirty body shout ! 
Until they saw a million bodies busting. 
[NEWLINE]
These tired fingers screaming after locking, 
And going through too many heavy ripping ! 
I wanna hear the only engine knocking ! 
Another day another second slipping. 

To use their own entire public sector. 
And over there not even legal matters ! 
Or where we could become another member, 
And stay surrounded by aspiring actors. 
[NEWLINE]
Its like an underwater demolition ! 
I wanna know how many human peers, 
Are you the most professional musician ! 
They only really care about careers. 

Surrounded by an orange texas hula. 
My baby cousin named louisiana, 
No crazy little biddy big kahuna ! 
I seen so many people from nebraska. 
[NEWLINE]
What ever happened under north dakota ! 
This day was like a second beach resort ! 
She started walking over oklahoma, 
And looking at the northern district court. 

For only many public holidays ! 
We never even know my pension plan ! 
I wanna study those creative ways, 
And wear the very little black sedan. 
[NEWLINE]
No one would ever rather tax relief, 
Than any human body really quaking. 
I could depend upon a clover leaf, 
Or at a hundred billion futures trading. 

Too busy having something most appealing, 
A party going on without no doubt ! 
These inner feelings like its merely seeming ! 
The human life has simply pointed out. 
[NEWLINE]
What helps this simple knowledge manifest. 
So when my thoughts begin to feel disdain, 
Or ever thought of whom i may suggest ! 
Are you the only one that could explain. 

Too busy reading toni morrison, 
For love with any younger cousin jenny ! 
The waitress started drinking judy gordon, 
But mommy only wanna marry becky. 
[NEWLINE]
Her daddy named a roger bonnie sadie, 
Not even ever married jesse jerry ! 
Was kinda really like my uncle kathy ! 
She bought a very curly sweaty betty. 

For mother nature equals non aggression. 
But life becomes a peaceful resolution ! 
And at with only foreign intervention, 
We need to reach their very own conclusion. 
[NEWLINE]
Against this world of human race competing ! 
I know another place without enforce ! 
No matter whether under power leading, 
Or being summoned by the holy force. 

And only children under peter bien. 
Who thought that life no longer weaves together, 
But then this moment had become unseen ! 
A very little daughter jennifer. 
[NEWLINE]
We know how many future generations, 
Or any other psychic energy ! 
Remember looking at my own frustrations, 
Escaping from a working memory. 

They never really care about parades, 
Who sang an old piano on ballet. 
I like their tiny pretty little maids, 
Each morning when the band begins to play. 
[NEWLINE]
Her fingers whispered softly sweetly faire, 
No longer having lots of happy drinking ! 
Are wearing shiny rosy underwear ! 
That sexy little dancing body piercing. 

About what happened after christmas vale ! 
Can you remember billy river tay. 
Is there so many people royal mail, 
But never ever gotta round replay. 
[NEWLINE]
No matter at the local shopping centre ! 
Another little london stock exchange, 
For any other human being chester ! 
And like an only great dividing range. 

My own entire motor generator. 
They know how many tons of stainless steel, 
Is never ever getting any straighter, 
This world behind an empty steering wheel. 
[NEWLINE]
We only need another deadly thread ! 
No matter where we carry massive straps ! 
I gotta sticky little garlic bread ! 
A hundred million people blasting caps. 

They really wanna know about commission ! 
It sounded like a logical extension ! 
My mother bought a parachute division, 
For me to marry captain benjamin. 
[NEWLINE]
With charlie wilson versus eric b. 
We started talking over graphic symbols, 
Taking orders from the rooted tree ! 
No one was having any principles. 

Living under nasal cavity ! 
This way too many wounds no longer aching, 
And telling me to cause mortality ! 
The world was only human muscle wasting. 
[NEWLINE]
I feel my very own hallucination, 
I need a manual manipulation. 
But where are you so easily mistaken ! 
For worse than any other medication. 

Would rather drift away without explaining ! 
Who thought that life was such an awful phase, 
Like they never ever stopped creating ! 
Or see how many other brothers raise. 
[NEWLINE]
For when this solar system started splitting, 
And then we simply gotta introduce. 
It puts an index finger on the mixing ! 
A message from a human mind reduce. 

El hombre como este mundo ander, 
En cada dia mucho nuevo nina. 
No soy un poco para bom de amor ! 
How many people gonna die kristina. 
[NEWLINE]
Or ever wanna see a diet pepsi, 
Is also really total santa cruz ! 
Can you remember lisa ellen terry ! 
Not even any negative reviews. 

Her baby mother cousin stella dallas. 
Her daddy married edgar kennedy ! 
An english former pornographic actress, 
I guess she only likes to marry harry. 
[NEWLINE]
His husband sits upon the dressing table, 
A very special mona lisa jessie, 
I really truly happy edgar mabel ! 
My lovely lady mrs. Mister debbie. 

And under any creature you employ. 
But maybe only frozen vegetables ! 
Has no-one ever tasted corduroy, 
Or ever finished eating old utensils. 
[NEWLINE]
His trousers mixed with little richard steels, 
He never really even sucked de icing ! 
A billion hundred thousand spinning wheels, 
A million stories by the silver lining. 

Not any other mother youngest brandy ! 
Its such an accidental overdose. 
I know another number one cat fancy, 
The only poison from my oral dose. 
[NEWLINE]
This bleeding heart has never fallen ill ! 
So see how many people blister packs ! 
What happens when i need a sleeping pill, 
To move without an old equation ax. 

Too many people getting busy ku ! 
I never seen so many smiles o c ! 
Not there to see my brother johnny pu, 
Are gonna follow cos omega t. 
[NEWLINE]
But any expectation operator ! 
Is nothing like we need an alpha alpha, 
For giving me an extra multi layer ! 
I only wanna pontiac montana. 

Eternal power where abandoned mines, 
Is at my own entire safety net ! 
No one with any other foot defines ! 
I see a better human training vet. 
[NEWLINE]
Than water under heavy iron ore. 
Who needs an itty bit manipulation, 
Global land and planet dublin core, 
To love the world without communication. 

Not even really wanna celebrate ! 
These very tiny little celtic nations, 
I thought this world was such an easy date ! 
So many pretty children from vacations. 
[NEWLINE]
I bought another special salary. 
We had a merry christmas celebration ! 
To join the latest motorcycle rally, 
With people on their daily circulation. 

Not going home without prosperity, 
Or even followed any other regions ! 
So many places where we landed gentry ! 
This town is full of economic reasons. 
[NEWLINE]
Are coming from the mississippi delta ! 
To see a new entire world surrounding. 
Surrounded by surrounding area, 
And global tanks and residential housing. 

Persona diddley cretin buddy ee, 
My pretty baby me and bobby ali !

They never ever liked a workers party. 
[NEWLINE]
That itty bitty little biddy ahh, 
For those who could remember howard dean, 
No one was really happy uncle naw ! 
He had a very merry wife eileen. 

His little sister named marie christine. 
My father had another tax collector, 
No one was gonna meet again kathleen ! 
To offer me a million dollar member. 
[NEWLINE]
For those who ever marry uncle walter ! 
He may not any other guy sebastian, 
Or you can never see an elder daughter ! 
An only secret tennis champion. 

Remember when their heads are obsolete. 
Not even matter nelson rockefeller, 
Or going over any local suite ! 
Too busy looking at electric fender. 
[NEWLINE]
I wanna see another studio ! 
They dream about suburban radios, 
And little children playing stereo, 
And swinging from an english billy rose. 

Another lonely moment after never ! 
A million faces better yet so sadly, 
Who wander through this world forever ever ! 
No longer feeding on depravity. 
[NEWLINE]
They know that life is only harsh and callous. 
How many people die without despair, 
Or try to suffer from eternal sadness ! 
But nothing ever changes everywhere. 

That there are only human mental healing, 
We need another cardiac arrest ! 
This common balance where no one is needing, 
An easy way to interrupt request. 
[NEWLINE]
The very little children comatose ! 
Too many people having seeming lack. 
I may not even use a single dose ! 
But you can never really ever quack. 

And watch how many people runners up ! 
They know that funny little crazy taxi, 
Is coming from my european cup. 
A hundred thousand billion grand finale. 
[NEWLINE]
Another million dollar runner ups ! 
To see an equal talent competition, 
Or any other european cups ! 
Im talkin bout a heavyweight division. 

Have ever needed any new advise ! 
A thousand million minds become secure, 
Too busy having economic ties. 
Not yet the only one without assure. 
[NEWLINE]
No social power could manipulate, 
We gotta push and then accelerate ! 
So please consider me participate ! 
Divine reaction from eliminate. 

Remember smiling lips were barely squeezing ! 
But such a thousand sexy fingertips ! 
No one was standing there completely leaning, 
And touching me with any finger tips. 
[NEWLINE]
So very gently having easy kissing, 
Afraid of being old enough to tease ! 
Or maybe never ever really slipping ! 
Too busy falling on my hands and knees. 

For any very little opposition ! 
Is there so many words to navigate, 
With sickness reproduced without permission. 
These walls are closing through an open gate. 
[NEWLINE]
They follow me too busy being strait, 
Or running from a vicious user clicks ! 
Another human mind eliminate ! 
Surrounded by attack of dirty tricks. 



They know it smells extremely awful sweet. 
The germans at the mini voyage aux, 
Is buying flowers from an apple wheat ! 
No other happy children could bestow. 
[NEWLINE]
Some people drinking water cooking oil ! 
And while we drink a little food to eat ! 
I like this very lovely sandy soil, 
Or maybe even eating chicken meat. 

Not really matter whether spicy taste, 
Or feet or any very busy bee ! 
I know its only human solid waste, 
It offers me another daily fee. 
[NEWLINE]
How many other people urban planning ! 
What happens when this mother earth is caving ! 
I wanna see an old companion planting, 
The urge to feel a single seater racing. 

Some pretty ladies party knights commander ! 
Are taking over Mister seraphim ! 
And laughing at the purple scottish manor, 
Too busy sucking on my high esteem. 
[NEWLINE]
I wanna see a hundred billion knights, 
Who never tries to purchase reggie noble ! 
But there is only one religious rites ! 
No need for any ceremonial. 

Would love to hang with judy elton sally. 
And you was saying bobby rosa ellen, 
Diana mia eva cassidy ! 
They follow me egyptian heroine. 
[NEWLINE]
I know an old piano competition ! 
Her baby daddy married uncle jessie, 
A mother nanny cousin Mister simpson ! 
The mona lisa tony spanish jenny. 

Too many people calling calvin harris ! 
To know that you was sitting on chanel ! 
But also biggie versus cathy dennis, 
And from the local paradise motel. 
[NEWLINE]
He bought a pretty little baby nipple, 
Or maybe really even alan jackson. 
I never thought i had a charting single, 
For making me remember toni braxton. 

Become another human garment worn. 
No rather never part of any kind, 
Or know that very little saddle horn ! 
The only one specifically designed. 
[NEWLINE]
But people wear so many fingers peeking ! 
A silver blade upon an oral piercing, 
For me to offer you completely sealing ! 
And even though my head is slowly spinning. 

My shattered body felt so deeply shaken. 
I thought i could have never ever snapped ! 
This endless mental crashing suffocation, 
Are running through my mind becoming trapped. 
[NEWLINE]
Surrounded by another pilot error, 
How many new entire worlds collide ! 
A thousand bodies under cabin pressure ! 
The plane becomes apparent suicide. 

Being under human labour party, 
The new entire channel pumping station ! 
For special economic policy, 
To british latest social presentation. 
[NEWLINE]
Its very massive daily private venture. 
With mental fully global licence fee ! 
This world within a total public sector ! 
An other level planet bbc. 

And kindness had become appreciated ! 
How many happy people also merry, 
But only human being underrated. 
They hear my spirit falling merrily. 
[NEWLINE]
Not even ever feeling strangely quite, 
I feel as though it never really snappy ! 
I see a beauty from divine delight ! 
This world is such an awful flattery. 

Is waiting there for those who could outrun, 
We hear their own entire nation quitting ! 
How many friends are having harmless fun, 
Not any human being fully willing. 
[NEWLINE]
Or going back to private companies ! 
No one surrounded by police protection, 
They need a hundred million dollar fees ! 
I guess it really pays too much attention. 

People telling me that you was dead ! 
This very little baby hanged himself, 
A weapon pointed at my severed head ! 
His body back and then he hanged herself. 
[NEWLINE]
With one so many bodies tied to silken ! 
What happened when her mother started screaming, 
She only had another crucifixion ! 
I never ever saw an angel leaping. 

A mental mathematical description, 
Other masses at rotation rate. 
No longer frightened by this great transition ! 
Too many people you anticipate. 
[NEWLINE]
To never ever see an atom stellar, 
Not even any normal distribution ! 
Are really such a sensitive detector ! 
And only one genetic contribution. 

Fifty billion people getting rushed. 
They wanna feel this fatal suffocation, 
We know that there is only something flushed ! 
No need for any little complication. 
[NEWLINE]
Not gonna suffer under total danger ! 
But you have shed so many tears to hasten, 
The poison from another organ failure ! 
How could i ever had no medication. 

Any other little billionaire. 
Or when my father died an early former, 
To see another multi millionaire ! 
He thought his middle name was jesse walter. 
[NEWLINE]
And Mister davis versus Mister mayor, 
About the local county state department ! 
We started living on a soccer player ! 
Not only being very prominent. 

Has given me another potent symbol, 
Being punished by their own frustration. 
To add a non aggression principle, 
Or on a daily mental mutilation. 
[NEWLINE]
I feel this planet causing deprivation, 
Become becoming highly critical ! 
No one is such a passive situation, 
For being very hypocritical. 

Not even any other channel ar ! 
No one can bury me without addictions ! 
I wanna sink another rental car ! 
With pockets full of previous convictions. 
[NEWLINE]
A hundred million dollar lexus models, 
The only way to write my own prescription. 
Too busy thinking over empty bottles, 
And use the money reading colin wilson. 

Or maybe you were really gonna mow ! 
We only wanted any local rambler, 
For fifty hundred dollar auto show ! 
My mother bought an old electric tractor. 
[NEWLINE]
His middle finger drinking engine ridden, 
And driving over steam calliope. 
A lotta people started rolling friction ! 
My little honda motor company. 

So please why bother making me reply ! 
It seems as though the words are merely telling ! 
No one should know that something might apply, 
And use my very own excuse for letting. 
[NEWLINE]
We need a little money you can buy ! 
Is there too many others crying out, 
Than any other people could comply, 
Or going through another world without. 

About that daily mental mutilation ! 
Not even matter any color vision, 
Or second manual manipulation. 
This soul is only physical description. 
[NEWLINE]
I know the very damage you engraved, 
Its face revolves around my rotting brain ! 
I wanna see a thousand bodies shaved ! 
Another twisted pretty little mane. 

We never ever had already po ! 
He pays di english devore qu a trois, 
I even know some other print hello, 
Un petit changer les moulin de la. 
[NEWLINE]
Have married daddy yankee est de vie ! 
An alla pero este mundo ou, 
D dias entre lui hasta ly, 
And se en cada dia para que. 

What ever happened after graduation, 
Was guided by the greatest scholarship. 
Who taught this secondary education, 
To form an endless tense relationship. 
[NEWLINE]
Not any human beings being nerds ! 
Or even other orders decorations ! 
I never know how many nonsense words, 
Are only mathematical foundations. 

They never wanna ever single martyr ! 
No one is only human worthy leper ! 
I wonder little mother royal scholar, 
To see this holy roman emperor. 
[NEWLINE]
For goodness gracious missionary priest ! 
Not even any russian tennis player, 
Or when we need another christian feast ! 
A truly mighty noble holy savior. 

They really wanna doctor robert simpson, 
Too many people from select committee ! 
That little labour party politician, 
Are selling garrison artillery. 
[NEWLINE]
Their spirits on a scottish independence ! 
This world is only even regent street. 
My very most official residence ! 
To dream of life without a wooden seat. 

Can add an awful bunch of latin squares ! 
No matter where these words become unique ! 
As people ever wear so many pairs, 
They only use their very own technique. 
[NEWLINE]
The solar system needs another pair, 
To follow me wherever you are flipping ! 
Surrounded by a giant magic square, 
Not even need for any second bidding. 

Perhaps create a better situation, 
Than you have ever thought about explaining. 
Which one has given me an explanation ! 
And even though these words are merely stating. 
[NEWLINE]
But yet so many people could agree ! 
Not like that any other reason never ! 
I know my very own ability, 
To see another question altogether. 

Surrounded by a million dollar winner. 
But after only fifty seconds swung, 
And spun around this pretty little finger ! 
So many hundred thousand bodies slung. 
[NEWLINE]
Forever trapped within a broken knot, 
Or nothing ever coming over twice ! 
My blood is breaking through the melting pot, 
My life becomes an endless sacrifice. 

What other people could no use explaining. 
And dare not bother asking me why do ! 
My friends are yet too busy being stating, 
To see this funny little interview. 
[NEWLINE]
So many years ago without a doubt ! 
I never even wanted anything, 
But there is nothing ever pointed out ! 
I guess we had enough of everything. 

A system where anxiety creates. 
No need for any other crop rotation, 
Or giving me another hell awaits ! 
To form the most fantastic combination. 
[NEWLINE]
What you create so many worlds combined ! 
A hundred billion thousand random samples, 
Human beings yet become refined ! 
Created by their very own examples. 

Remember something you already know, 
That matters more than any eye can see ! 
How could the thought of ever letting go, 
A very little human being free. 
[NEWLINE]
Who really cares about what others say ! 
So many changes started breaking through. 
No one was having such an easy way ! 
We had enough of nothing else to do. 

Is worse than any other imitation, 
But only one designed specifically ! 
The vast entire oral medication ! 
With global chemical stability. 
[NEWLINE]
A burning surface from synthetic plastic ! 
Are slowly sinking under liquid crystal. 
Too many twisted minds become organic, 
Or human beings being artificial. 

Some stupid rappers better try explaining ! 
They may have seen what others could despise, 
Or know the fact that you were merely stating ! 
As any other person criticize. 
[NEWLINE]
It sounded like another little might, 
Not even bothered by the human touch ! 
Too busy being old enough to write, 
So many people thinking pretty much. 

Remember any second you was sowing ! 
His arm around their middle fingers blasting, 
And laughed until this party started loading, 
We could have ya entire system tapping. 
[NEWLINE]
How many suckers ever wanna scratch ! 
They know what happens when the world is spinning ! 
I gotta hundred million dollar patch, 
To catch my trigger finger cocked and drilling. 

We gotta meet maria hasta bella ! 
So listen mister Mister mrs. rita, 
Can you forget my sorry aunt rebecca. 
Im gonna drink another margarita. 
[NEWLINE]
Or even bother looking over helen ! 
Not reading from a portrait gallery ! 
I never wanted any heroine, 
For me to marry lady henry patty. 

A very little hidden combination ! 
This place no one are ever truly treating. 
Some people may accept determination, 
Not even wait for second central heating. 
[NEWLINE]
Too busy making proper preparation, 
To see what only life can generate ! 
My own potential special presentation ! 
I need an easy way to demonstrate. 

For certain mother nature finds herself. 
She watches from the very other hand, 
And even though his mind reveals himself ! 
A little something you must understand. 
[NEWLINE]
Is such an awful thing about behaving, 
Or maybe only having human brains ! 
I ever really wanna feel a claiming ! 
That any other person else explains. 

We gotta dirty tiny little toaster. 
No simple music counter melody ! 
That pretty shiny yellow movie poster, 
To me or very kindly pirate jenny. 
[NEWLINE]
Can you remember any fairy tale, 
Her sister on the world is only fiction ! 
This little modern story fairytale, 
I really wanna know a certain villain. 

And see how many people could withstand ! 
It only grows equipped with laser wyer, 
No need for any customer demand ! 
I know he never gives complete designer. 
[NEWLINE]
She needs too busy wearing calvin klein. 
The giant pile of random molded plastic, 
Are also strangled by unseen design, 
Or nothing at this world is very graphic. 

These other suckers better send email. 
So please consider me an interview ! 
How many people gonna send e mail, 
Or when my job is really overdue. 
[NEWLINE]
Too many under any western draft ! 
A hundred thousand dollar boxer shorts ! 
I gotta add another nikki craft, 
And try to practice media reports. 

Or even know my very bottom line, 
Not gonna care about this grassy hill ! 
Who wanna see that lovely cherry pine ! 
I gotta shiny yellow leather grill. 
[NEWLINE]
And only crossing olive boulevard ! 
They never need another crystal ball. 
A crowded room behind an empty yard, 
Or houses running over city hall. 

Who wanna even bother alex harvey, 
Too many people under laurel canyon ! 
Have any message over santa charlie ! 
Or sing another song of luscious jackson. 
[NEWLINE]
A party going on this christmas brenda ! 
Can you remember tony buddy holly, 
Maria calling Mister spanish stella, 
The night was really very lovely bobbie. 

Is nothing like another student body ! 
I gotta lotta people flying lessons, 
Too many principal photography, 
For making money outta major sessions. 
[NEWLINE]
I bought a hundred thousand years probation. 
This year was only graduation rate ! 
And you already had an invitation ! 
We never really could participate. 

Not only any human being very, 
For such a lovely flower vary greatly ! 
Are you too busy drinking heavily ! 
They offer me an early evening rainy. 
[NEWLINE]
I try to travel onto something rarely. 
No matter where the studio releases ! 
Each day another winter solitary, 
Is falling like an autumn summer breezes. 

It carries me across this barren land ! 
Its only yellow mountain scenery, 
For you to see that rocky mountain sand ! 
Was never covered under greenery. 
[NEWLINE]
Who could have any uncle walter crane, 
Or maybe selling rocks or rolling hills ! 
And there is nothing like a new terrain ! 
I wanna know about artistic skills. 

About an old hotel or tulsa port. 
It happened under mobile alabama ! 
My little baby talking stick resort, 
That very northern richmond indiana. 
[NEWLINE]
Ohio river over tampa bay, 
And then we started outta jacksonville ! 
Remember going back to santa fe ! 
We rode together like a chapel hill. 

This very really stupid headless horseman ! 
Who ever even thought about renee ! 
I never could remember nina gordon, 
Was making money under tampa bay. 
[NEWLINE]
And people walking outta nathan lane ! 
A crazy little lady named amelia, 
We also bought an english bayou cane, 
To see the germans at a juan maria. 

Who could appear upon its highest peak, 
Or yet my relative stability ! 
I hope it only happens after week, 
We know each other human being nearly. 
[NEWLINE]
This world is such a very great event ! 
Too many people any longer waxing ! 
Are you expecting something permanent, 
To see the greatest freedom ever lasting. 

To know what happened under silver crystal. 
Or when this heavy iron plastic shield, 
Is slowly breaking through electric sickle ! 
Too many open arms are tightly sealed. 
[NEWLINE]
Another hundred thousand dollar tags ! 
My tiny little rusty letters patent ! 
The water running over leather bags, 
And being frightened by a lion rampant. 

This tiny crippled organs neatly scattered. 
I could no longer suffer from regain ! 
It sank a shattered body deeply battered, 
Or tripped upon another baggage train. 
[NEWLINE]
These tired feelings slowly devastating ! 
But only then so many wounds restored, 
To carry me wherever you were taking ! 
The loss of kindness had already soared. 

Too many holy english speaking countries ! 
Who wanna visit from nebraska lincoln, 
But also only scientific studies ! 
Is measured by an accurate description. 
[NEWLINE]
No equal social science manual, 
Or any other junior secondary. 
We need to use the semi classical, 
And add a new behavior therapy. 

So pretty little baby gotta say ! 
What happens at that very special way ! 
These simple feelings simply fade away ! 
We only need another rainy day. 
[NEWLINE]
No greater love than any eye can see ! 
This feeling like an arrow going through, 
Is like a river running over me. 
And even when my dreams are coming true. 

They only really wanna wonder mayor ! 
Are ye not having any irish former ! 
No one would ever marry captain baker, 
Or even dad was also senior porter. 
[NEWLINE]
I need another younger secretary, 
To see the very famous little pastor ! 
My baby daddy had an uncle jesse, 
For being treated like a vice commander. 

His soul is buried under viking raid ! 
An empty tower temporarily, 
This mighty creature carries on decayed ! 
Has nothing ever handled carefully. 
[NEWLINE]
Would you depend upon an easy prey ! 
Or travel through a hundred mortar shells, 
To see how many people blew away ! 
I only know another legend tells. 

Modern new entire human sub. 
They really even wonder Mister mayor ! 
Are coming from another giant hub, 
But never very ever heroes acre. 
[NEWLINE]
The only second port authority, 
Is having mutual annihilation ! 
We travel newly conquered territory ! 
Not like an english russian federation. 

A million billion people brought together ! 
No one can see how many other teachers, 
Who ever needs a visiting professor ! 
For children there are only doubles leaders. 
[NEWLINE]
We need another spiritual teacher, 
To join their very own psychology ! 
A most entire lecture theatre ! 
They preach about the public policy. 

Who could have had enough of being winning, 
Not even watching any other soccer ! 
I wanna hear an early morning bidding, 
For making me a very better starter. 
[NEWLINE]
To see what happens when my heart is racing ! 
Not busy living under dungeons dragons, 
I never seen too many people playing ! 
Surrounded by division champions. 



The great united state of java ee ! 
Are you potential social multi user, 
Or cause this solar system java me ! 
I wanna paint another black computer. 
[NEWLINE]
So please reveal my inner mental sender ! 
The ruling java virtual machine, 
Is also captured by a fatal error, 
And never bought an instant session bean. 

This crazy feeling after letting go, 
And change my senses going crazy right ! 
Who cares about what you already know. 
Not gonna stay another lonely night. 
[NEWLINE]
I need an angel watching over me ! 
Too many faces like the others say, 
A thousand places where no one can see ! 
So many feelings slowly fade away. 

We also need another massive laser, 
To watch so many thoughts become organic. 
Or bein created by the nearest neighbour, 
With solid flesh and body like elastic. 
[NEWLINE]
Official elemental composition ! 
Are coming outta galaxy formation ! 
This like a mental order phase transition, 
For giving me precise determination. 

So often while my friends are getting nearer ! 
I had this feeling any longer quite, 
I really rather busy being Mister. 
The one that carries me away despite. 
[NEWLINE]
No matter where it may become a shrill ! 
Not yet another day or maybe never ! 
Too many lonely people standing still, 
Enough to feel a little worse than ever. 

An early morning feeling kinda praised ! 
Who ever saw a very heavy drinker, 
Too busy looking at himself amazed, 
But then his daddy had heroic figure. 
[NEWLINE]
He sang a song without appreciation ! 
Who cares about another reputation ! 
Forget about the younger generation. 
My father offered me an inspiration. 

We also really wanna copy mode ! 
I know how many new composing stick ! 
This song is written under random code ! 
No one can never hear another click. 
[NEWLINE]
So please consider me obituary. 
I wonder whether flying buffalo, 
Or travel through an english dictionary ! 
Not even any color indigo. 

People living under latin squares, 
Or any very special observation ! 
No room for overseas chinese affairs, 
This world is such a passive expectation. 
[NEWLINE]
I wanna see another new selection, 
Escape the mathematical equation ! 
Become an open mind disease prevention ! 
We need to join uncertainty relation. 

Is coming from an orange pizza parlor. 
I gotta hundred million dollar trailer ! 
Are you too busy drinking bonnie parker, 
Or any famous local undertaker. 
[NEWLINE]
To join his very own jamaica inn ! 
Remember Mister southern vegas owner, 
An empty pocket full of rubbish bin ! 
We had a little private rollercoaster. 

No room for those abandoned petrol station. 
Too many people over there garage ! 
Was never ever gonna change location, 
Number two entire entourage. 
[NEWLINE]
Or even visit any clothing store, 
About this very little town cafe ! 
Surrounded by the sound of local lore ! 
To party like a private getaway. 

Going under second ticket holder. 
Not even at the very final year ! 
My name was leaving town around october, 
And started from an amateur career. 
[NEWLINE]
It only happened when this world began, 
A hundred thousand million teams competing ! 
We need to see how many people ran, 
Or later on another public meeting. 

Power most created great transition. 
So many people under secret key ! 
They offer me this vertical position, 
To deal with only one identity. 
[NEWLINE]
I could create my very own computer, 
I never wanted any second shift ! 
And there is nothing very often user, 
Or such an endless spiritual gift. 

My only one and only billie jean. 
Each day i could remember old temptation, 
This wicked little lady named christine ! 
So many years of genesis creation. 
[NEWLINE]
To whom that mighty angel gabriel ! 
Was really truly mary howard caine, 
A most amazing uncle eric abel, 
A very pretty little daddy shane. 

Already had no second power steering, 
Or fifty hundred dollar license plate ! 
Was there so many people looking grinning ! 
They spent some early morning fishing bait. 
[NEWLINE]
She bought a working motor oldsmobile. 
And from his very pretty little skid ! 
My heart is sitting under steering wheel, 
He tries to offer me an engine lid. 

Those whose little hands are rarely used, 
We may not really care about behaving ! 
A hundred million souls become abused ! 
They know how many other people taking. 
[NEWLINE]
I hope to see another thing restrained, 
My life is getting longer very rarely. 
It aches for such as though no one complained ! 
I could have never even taken any. 

It from these golden days of winter lows, 
Their eyes were only human being slow ! 
They knew that you would often rather pose, 
Than water flowing under heavy snow. 
[NEWLINE]
A thousand stories may become extreme, 
An early morning skies are gonna vary ! 
Who cares about how many people seem, 
I know we could have travelled very rarely. 

For those who ever had attention fairly ! 
They never even wanted bobby steels. 
But yet he also suffered terribly, 
His body pounding over metal seals. 
[NEWLINE]
Not having any stress corrosion cracking ! 
We need a hundred thousand people cleaning, 
To see how many other girls are lacking ! 
I know this one is really massive heating. 

My mighty noble bitter enemy ! 
I may have seen so many sinners slain, 
For such an ancient semi legendary ! 
No one shall die within eternal vain. 
[NEWLINE]
Not yet a greater sovereign foster brother ! 
This tempest thou forever dwell upon ! 
Whose royal mother hath betrayed her lover, 
Who dared to suffer from egyptian khan. 

Remember those melinda gates foundation ! 
Not yet another genocide convention. 
But when i feel no need for compensation, 
Or being guided by a rare exception. 
[NEWLINE]
Prevent environmental degradation, 
Depending on this very little v ! 
We could have given you an obligation ! 
To see the number one divine decree. 

With seven hundred thousand dollar dues. 
I hope they never use their own discretion, 
Or even other public sporting news ! 
Not those who ever had a great exception. 
[NEWLINE]
But when we really need obtain permission, 
For any unconditional election ! 
The slightest use of felony conviction ! 
Another lesson from an old profession. 

Has struck another motor generator ! 
It at my own entire cell division ! 
Are coming from an old combustion chamber, 
To outer inner mental composition. 
[NEWLINE]
No longer follows me for forty days ! 
Not any one who ever stands alone, 
Or cause its only such a manic phase ! 
My mind directed by reciting tone. 

This final hour is only temporary ! 
But one of those who ever thought remain ! 
Are also often temporarily, 
Or try to mention human stomach pain. 
[NEWLINE]
I wanna see another shuttle mission ! 
Have seen so many dreams begin anew. 
The world has risen from an old decision, 
No matter where we know it may renew. 

Massive random social system driven ! 
So please accept divide and calculate ! 
An effort due for any false division ! 
I rather simply merely compensate. 
[NEWLINE]
These words are never truly introduced. 
Its such a very simple combination ! 
The only human being most reduced, 
Is also taken over concentration. 

Is getting better outta folding stock ! 
We gotta semi automatic pistol ! 
A super triple double plastic glock, 
With any fifty billion dollar missile. 
[NEWLINE]
It helps to battle by the fort mccoy. 
Have mercy on my target indication ! 
I wanna see another little oy, 
Mister deadly roland corporation. 

So busy doing something very clever ! 
I know their social thoughts become obscure. 
With such a sympathetic character, 
Who needs another name to reassure. 
[NEWLINE]
They follow me around without explaining, 
Not asking any questions after teasing ! 
But there is nothing wrong or even faking ! 
What happens when the truth remains misleading. 

To kill destruction after death remains ! 
An endless growing soul no longer heals ! 
Their spirits spilling over rotting brains ! 
I feel the power only one reveals. 
[NEWLINE]
A burning nation under silver crystal, 
This world remains eternal comatose. 
My mental life is getting pitiful ! 
They offer me another lethal dose. 

Or even need an extra triple crown, 
For ya entire nation stroke survivors ! 
Remember tony david clarence brown, 
Supreme official master sermon writers. 
[NEWLINE]
This jam is only talent competition ! 
We gonna welcome you to top contenders ! 
My vocal vocals by premier division, 
These rappers over verbal battle members. 

No matter where united teams compete ! 
They only had so many reservations. 
I know this very tiny little fleet, 
Is going through a daily destinations. 
[NEWLINE]
Another nation under two balloons ! 
Are writing songs about direct connections ! 
We wanna travel over greasy spoons, 
And add a hundred thousand taurus engines. 

This very lovely little alan kay ! 
They label me another multi user. 
And scratching at the video display, 
My own entire personal computer. 
[NEWLINE]
Not even having any nicky hilton ! 
Or maybe ever really being itty ! 
Too busy sucking on a hash collision, 
Without an overnight delivery. 

Is going under super circuit breaker, 
And second number one departed souls ! 
We gotta little devil fighter trainer ! 
Its coming over dirty sausage rolls. 
[NEWLINE]
He giving me electric manual, 
Or running underwater demolition. 
Im looking at another narrow angle, 
Attack of heavy metal black technician. 

We know this world is really least expensive ! 
My little mother from the tourist sector, 
Who try to offer me occult detective. 
I wanna see another private venture. 
[NEWLINE]
Or like an unemployment compensation ! 
Too many people at atlantic monthly ! 
Are living under daily circulation, 
And getting very busy spending money. 

Kentucky sally at magnolia manor, 
This town is going back to indiana ! 
Oh yeah we gotta boston massacre ! 
A texas mountain mobile alabama. 
[NEWLINE]
A seven little biddy molly pitcher ! 
Another lonesome southern tennessee, 
A lincoln county st. ohio river. 
And even though my name was edgar lee. 

Their daily money over loaded dice. 
It really matter equals random error, 
Or fifty hundred million dollar price ! 
A group of human beings getting fairer. 
[NEWLINE]
The germans at this very multi level, 
Too many people selling random ale ! 
To deal with mental health professional, 
And lyrics by another david gale. 

Not even matter focus nor maintain ! 
No way or ever gonna satisfy, 
That only other others may retain, 
Are being taken by its own supply. 
[NEWLINE]
This life is very easy ta obtain. 
And yet another rainy day we meet ! 
To see how many people could sustain ! 
What happens when the world becomes complete. 

That you are old enough to organize. 
This world is only private property, 
How many people do not recognize ! 
Who had a new decision making body. 
[NEWLINE]
A million thousand dollar companies ! 
The public unemployment compensation. 
Not even taking any guarantees, 
And living under major domination. 

Remember Mister holy mother sang. 
They only wanted something younger dear, 
But when the very little bigger bang, 
Was getting busy being real sincere. 
[NEWLINE]
Or looking at an ugly print hello ! 
And then my parents promised me that maybe ! 
What happened from a thousand years ago, 
Are going back together baby baby. 

So happy being drinking sugar spice, 
But only eating chocolate residue ! 
He had a belly full of polished rice, 
He tasted something like a spicy stew. 
[NEWLINE]
His soul was never ever gonna dye. 
Or maybe you can use a little cleaning, 
And even though my heart is running dry ! 
I know that you are very busy squeezing. 

Believe that you can fully utilize ! 
Not really ever guaranteed admission. 
But then how many people strengthen ties, 
With such as any other print edition. 
[NEWLINE]
His life is like a social presentation, 
He never needs another demonstration ! 
Who cares about melinda gates foundation ! 
Or see the only human operation. 

Being holding back my mood disorder, 
And join this very sacred congregation. 
His name is written under liquid water, 
These days are gonna stay within formation. 
[NEWLINE]
The children from their own disease progression, 
No hope for those or whom they may persist ! 
But then it sounded like a spawn collection, 
To know a place that never could exist. 

Or dancing at a summer matinee. 
And from an early evening invitation, 
That very lovely little music play ! 
This letter gives my number one ovation. 
[NEWLINE]
No need for me to wait until november ! 
I never wanna see another scene, 
Where it ever happened by september ! 
The world is such an awful dance routine. 

But only little lonely lovers know, 
Are something like an arrow going through ! 
I gotta let this crazy feeling go, 
And spend my life together loving you. 
[NEWLINE]
Is like a million feelings coming true ! 
Why never had it any other way. 
How many children feel the way we do ! 
Who really cares about what people say. 

A very little person merely non. 
We could create each other people rarely ! 
No matter where events are based upon, 
The road is never easy being any. 
[NEWLINE]
Who cares about what others may rely, 
Or blinded by an equal obligation ! 
As though they simply do not qualify, 
For those that you have truly limitation. 

Not looking at the highest egg collecting ! 
Too busy human being spotted deer, 
Is there an open pile of laws protecting ! 
How many children wear their fishing gear. 
[NEWLINE]
They know that you are gonna sag and snails ! 
And use a very little breeding pairs. 
No matter whether under pilot whales, 
Or even any holy grizzly bears. 

A hundred thousand tons of loaded dice ! 
Are flowing through an ancient reservoir, 
With very most electrical device. 
It only spins around electric car. 
[NEWLINE]
We gotta global power generation ! 
This world is burning like a diamond mine, 
Its like an open system pumping station, 
To add my number one transmission line. 

Would never even care what others said ! 
And on behalf of those who truly came, 
I knew that you were totally misled ! 
Perhaps they had an ego laying claim. 
[NEWLINE]
To know each other others heart denied, 
Not any question then appreciated ! 
Their greatest thought was really justified ! 
The one for whom it had already stated. 

We may not even care about prevention ! 
This system never needs communication. 
I need no greater human intervention, 
With any itty bit manipulation. 
[NEWLINE]
Another little com official site, 
Or one too many people bearing rocks ! 
My inner voice is getting copyright ! 
I travel under heavy metal stocks. 

Vanilla cherries on banana cake. 
An extra chicken sipping lemon gin, 
For you to see the rubber bunny bake ! 
Oh baby sugar royal wrinkled skin. 
[NEWLINE]
With pretty shiny leather glasses runny, 
That chocolate cherry candy jelly bean ! 
A lotta very little happy honey, 
Have hardly ever seen enough caffeine. 

O una vida hasta la revue ! 
Ha monte tu mirada oder der, 
Un nuevo dia alla entre deux. 
El amor esta forma para ver. 
[NEWLINE]
En este era una beacon press ! 
Un error entre cada coupe de med, 
En casa viva la diana es ! 
With bobby brown and sadie stanley ed. 

Its like an old unstable situation ! 
So fast but even though it does not alter, 
This place that you can only use rotation ! 
No one is going back to western border. 
[NEWLINE]
We gotta travel under cleavage planes, 
Or any greater human intervention. 
Another hundred thousand million lanes ! 
They kill each other by their own extension. 

A super turkey fresh banana roast ! 
I gotta boogie woogie woogie hee, 
With boiling water sipping chocolate toast ! 
My dad was only drinking sugar tea. 
[NEWLINE]
He offered me an orange candy dish, 
I hardly ever really wanna eat ! 
Or yet so busy sucking on raw fish, 
And smoking chicken eating human meat. 

Remember only human embryo, 
For action under social failure rates ! 
They need another digit ratio. 
No one can see so many other mates. 
[NEWLINE]
What happens when the sexual selection, 
Has taken something from an empty nest ! 
We never really thought about aggression ! 
About a sudden cardiac arrest. 

I never seen a woman named rebecca ! 
Her name is junior davis versus larry ! 
They know how many people married sarah, 
Who ever really married mother debbie. 
[NEWLINE]
And making me remember tony jessie, 
That sexy little sugar daddy randy ! 
She only had another sweaty betty, 
Or maybe something from an office nanny. 

It helps discover inner motion dazzle ! 
No one has ever thought about concealing, 
Who needs an open heart forever strangle ! 
I know these very simple words are keeping. 
[NEWLINE]
But any other person could betray, 
Is like the only one that you protect ! 
And wait until my senses slip away, 
Behind a thousand faces at collect. 

Remember everybody started hitting, 
That you was making such a big mistake ! 
And even though their eyes were only sticking. 
For one mistake we could no longer make. 
[NEWLINE]
But when it started getting kinda lazy ! 
So pretty busy moving very slow, 
Or something going on amazingly ! 
The sound of making heavy fingers throw. 

Remember getting better anyway, 
Why bother watching only children play ! 
It happens when the teacher walks away. 
And then she never thought she could betray. 
[NEWLINE]
Who really cares what everybody tells, 
Should ever see her pretty mama cry ! 
That funny silly little lady yells ! 
But there is such an easy way to try. 

Not even being human sport karate ! 
This world is going on with latin grammar. 
Im never gonna catch another hobby ! 
Its only one consuming double dagger. 
[NEWLINE]
Each other under any data sheet, 
Or see a little solar lantern slide ! 
A change of sight becoming obsolete, 
We could become the very tourist guide. 

Surrounded by contaminated food ! 
Too many people on connecting flights. 
No matter whether ceiling altitude, 
Or maybe even leo satellites. 
[NEWLINE]
Or any old electric elevator, 
They really wanna know about reload ! 
So pardon me and Mister operator, 
Who needs a message from the multi mode. 

Un poco para saber et de la ! 
El casa es milwaukee avenue, 
No se en una technicolor sa ! 
Un dia esta vida entre deux. 
[NEWLINE]
Im getting followed by fernando po. 
To travel over inner city regions, 
San francisco central junction aux ! 
I need a hundred thousand rainy seasons. 

To push a little further from oppression. 
So carry on no longer please defy ! 
This body needs some foreign intervention, 
I know that love is making me deny. 
[NEWLINE]
My friends are really gonna feel secure, 
Or maybe you would rather do not suffer ! 
We wanna spend another day assure ! 
About a million years of going under. 

Creating mental ocean circulation. 
Its like another leading hemisphere, 
To suffer from atomic devastation ! 
Upon this very massive atmosphere. 
[NEWLINE]
An awful state of cosmic radiation ! 
A human spirit causes degradation ! 
No matter where melinda gates foundation, 
Has never given me a drake equation. 

Not gonna suffer after death or beat, 
No fear for any second winning goal ! 
But when my own entire human feat, 
Are falling at the final heavy toll. 
[NEWLINE]
Is coming from an ugly bloody angle ! 
How many people dare admit defeat. 
They even try to win this bloody battle ! 
Another way of making me retreat. 

So very fully rather busy pitching. 
And fifty hundred billion dollar grip, 
For money while no other one is gripping ! 
Too many numbers on another hip. 
[NEWLINE]
A hundred thousand million people swinging ! 
With tiny open eyes become caressing, 
To hear this silly little rabbit kicking ! 
The gift that you was never ever bending. 

Not gonna hang around without explaining, 
Too busy having negative reactions. 
Or looking back for any second stating ! 
No one can hardly even see what happens. 
[NEWLINE]
He only had his very own email, 
But then they never ever could assume ! 
What happens on the internet e mail ! 
He tries to travel through a fitting room. 

We never really need attorney fees. 
So see my little brother david jason, 
These people at united companies ! 
Too many human tennis federation. 
[NEWLINE]
Are taking over absolute discretion, 
For life is based upon a bbc ! 
Another random group appointed chairman ! 
No other sort of parent company. 

So many people had exchanged between. 
And then an english public holiday, 
They never even bought a cocoa bean ! 
My mother aunt delilah sarah mae. 
[NEWLINE]
She saw another little water croak ! 
We started dancing on louisiana, 
And dirty zombies eating cherry coke, 
Was running from atlantic canada. 

Another second coming from predictions. 
They gonna battle me without comparing ! 
I hope and then discover new conditions, 
That you can hardly ever see no testing. 
[NEWLINE]
I never really wanna demonstrate ! 
What happens when the world becomes too brittle, 
Or any very graduation rate ! 
And taking over like an atlas missile. 

Remember early days without beginning, 
The very greatest moment you pursued ! 
So soon an ancient story started bringing ! 
But even though no one remained renewed. 
[NEWLINE]
We spent a hundred thousand souls acquired. 
Not any single question ever drew, 
Was there too many people getting fired ! 
My heart began to possibly pursue. 

Surrounded by my greatest millionaire, 
I hid behind this pretty small cafe ! 
No one who ever had an empty chair ! 
Was very busy selling triple j. 
[NEWLINE]
And people having talent competition. 
With fifty hundred million featuring, 
For any famous little paris hilton ! 
To show the world of other teams competing. 

Would really matter any other latter ! 
Which way to use their very own expression, 
Or yet another pistol caliber. 
So many ways of common comprehension. 
[NEWLINE]
No hope for any possibility, 
Or others may refer specifically ! 
This world is like a human rooted tree, 
An only sexual activity. 

So please consider me an open letter. 
We gotta stay together while awaiting, 
Not like it ever happened by september ! 
To see this very little public stating. 
[NEWLINE]
I wanna hear another letter dated ! 
A number one is really overdue, 
For having such an eagerly awaited ! 
No matter whether english nor untrue. 

They join themselves upon their celtic nations ! 
As one entire word is merely greek. 
We form a hundred thousand generations, 
To see each day another holy week. 
[NEWLINE]
But most of those and mystery religions, 
Are simply only global gender roles ! 
Too many people selling new traditions ! 
An ancient spirit under totem poles. 

Is when their mother nature ran away ! 
He may not care for any social sickness. 
I know no matter where the children pray, 
They could create an awful painful illness. 
[NEWLINE]
So many other people wanna greet, 
With such a medical facility ! 
It only needs another food to eat ! 
We carry onto something very sickly. 

It only matter you communicate, 
What else can any longer pacify ! 
This poor entire world eliminate ! 
Too many people looking at supply. 
[NEWLINE]
Who needs protection from an open sole, 
A person where no one is truly able. 
Depending on my mind assumed control ! 
Or see the fear of being proved unable. 

That when a single face became embracing, 
As one for those who ever helped create, 
Not even human being started praising ! 
I never knew my life was really great. 
[NEWLINE]
But then they threaten me with admiration. 
No matter whether great or scientific ! 
An endless state of total preservation ! 
The only way to focus on artistic. 

A million hundred billion atom set. 
No need for any carbon copy q ! 
We play this little alto clarinet, 
Each single nation under social mu. 
[NEWLINE]
What could become another new dimension ! 
Are you directed by velocity ! 
It never matter whether blues progression, 
Or even universal property. 

Surrounded by a million children proving. 
As though it may become an easy taking ! 
I guess they might have really finished choosing, 
To where their parents never started making. 
[NEWLINE]
And those whose hands are very busy using, 
The only further questions from expecting ! 
Too many people looking at pursuing ! 
Not having any hope for ever letting. 

To see how many other people lacked ! 
These words that had created constant measure, 
And then no longer may remain exact. 
Not yet prepared for any human error. 
[NEWLINE]
Is there another way of going under ! 
My mind has given me consideration, 
The strength to carry on this crystal structure ! 
It could create a certain combination. 

For being selling chocolate chili pepper ! 
Too many people under pumpkin wheat, 
And you can see what kinda flavor texture ! 
Are you so very busy eating meat. 
[NEWLINE]
Not asking me about creative ways, 
Or fifty billion dollar pigeon peas. 
No matter where the kitchen table sprays, 
An extra money over planting trees. 

Who also wears that lovely candy cane ! 
This lady on vanilla apple barley ! 
She dances through an orange robin lane, 
With you my little baby misses mari. 
[NEWLINE]
His name and then he feeds exclusively, 
To sing about the naked garden peas. 
Some pretty women acting very fruity, 
Or maybe eating rice and cherry trees. 

Have given me another new exchange ! 
This world is living under mounting pressure ! 
How many other people dare arrange, 
That you can hardly wait until november. 
[NEWLINE]
My very formal diplomatic ties ! 
A little diplomatic isolation, 
Or maybe then no one would jeopardize ! 
I could create a social declaration. 

Remember mama gonna marry donnie. 
For you till early morning Mister manny, 
With any mona lisa jenny bobby ! 
Not even worry pretty baby nancy. 
[NEWLINE]
Oh eddie peter billy daddy spender, 
I only wanna see my cousin larry ! 
He carries me across the purple heather, 
Without a very merry christmas debbie. 

Not really living under tuna stamp, 
Not yet too busy eating jelly bean. 
This song was such a very lovely tramp ! 
He never had another final scene. 
[NEWLINE]
But there is nothing loosely based upon, 
My name are you lorenzo lewis hine ! 
I wanna see the royal hair salon ! 
Upon an early morning neon sign. 

Creating something carefully designed. 
These little words are gonna isolate ! 
But maybe only other worlds combined, 
And then no one would rather concentrate. 
[NEWLINE]
Or worse than any other could create, 
A common human being specialize ! 
So let the solar system generate ! 
We never really gotta analyze. 

An endless human race against disaster ! 
Was yet too busy being driven back, 
Or going through so many heavy valor ! 
He had another broken heart attack. 
[NEWLINE]
Some day we watched his final slow decline, 
But then another engine started signing. 
And when i saw an old defensive line, 
It sounded like a little bitter fighting. 

The virgin mary sits with patrick ness, 
And on an early marriage ceremony, 
My life revolves around her wedding dress ! 
I know this world is only matrimony. 
[NEWLINE]
I wonder whether loving seated woman, 
Or having any other wedding gowns ! 
Or never ever wear another turban ! 
Her kisses dancing under velvet crowns. 

Forever giving you no limitations ! 
I never needed any food supply ! 
I travel seven younger generations, 
Who wanna carry me extremely high. 
[NEWLINE]
So many people lack consideration ! 
Are driven by their own ability ! 
To matter cause an old ideal location, 
Has taken something from a high degree. 

Oh very sorry mrs. thomas bryan ! 
They started saying mister ellen terry, 
Or even try to marry william ryan, 
His name was also over santa jessie. 
[NEWLINE]
With brian davis versus jesse grady ! 
She sang a song about my cousin andy ! 
The mona lisa married henry casey, 
He only had an early morning stanley. 

No other way another story plays, 
Its on but never going secondary ! 
Some people follow through so many ways, 
They simply use not necessarily. 
[NEWLINE]
And yet it may not even matter though ! 
Is there too many people passing by, 
A certain guy who likes to see below ! 
It only happens when the rules apply. 

Another message from magnetic z ! 
My new annihilation operator, 
Mission only sin omega t, 
Which one has given me an open laser. 
[NEWLINE]
To see who really needs a davy medal ! 
Not even having any concentration, 
Or being under chemical potential. 
The use of penetrating radiation. 

Those who ever had enough description ! 
For peace with only one identity ! 
Not even any formal definition, 
Would rather use some tiny little pee. 
[NEWLINE]
And then another barber paradox. 
We know that most entire world connection, 
Is being guided by a meaning ox, 
The facts of children learn to slang expression. 

Have mercy on an endless wicked cycle. 
With carnal eyes await divine ascension, 
No matter where belief is only rightful ! 
We need a greater gift of new conception. 
[NEWLINE]
This darkness hath become annihilation, 
To true creation unto humankind ! 
Behold the very moment thou awaken ! 
I worship thine eternal human mind. 

Children selling human credit squeeze. 
Each one with seven hundred billion debts, 
And home no longer paying legal fees ! 
Too many people breaking safety nets. 
[NEWLINE]
They know that there is only drug possession ! 
We travel under double city ferry, 
Or from a million dollar toll collection ! 
To see the world has fallen steadily. 

Twenty fifty hundred gallon bic. 
How many people gotta golden strap, 
Their very mighty pretty yellow brick ! 
They bought that double barrel blasting cap. 
[NEWLINE]
The multi thousand million dollar beads ! 
But you can cover me with nickel silver, 
And heavy water bubble faster speeds ! 
To pin an itchy finger on my zipper. 

They wanna see another brother terry. 
This song is also calling tony tommy, 
For any second album elton jerry ! 
And mrs. bobby gary mary robbie. 
[NEWLINE]
Or terry lewis versus michael jackson ! 
But you remember mona lisa nelly, 
An angel from the eyes of toni braxton, 
Too busy looking at my uncle jesse. 

Not going under any mountain chains ! 
Or only northern central interstate. 
That lonesome valley mountain river drains, 
My way along this lonely island strait. 
[NEWLINE]
How very many new unnamed location, 
Can never see another narrow strip ! 
An ancient state of lowest elevation ! 
I feel surrounded by an eastern tip. 

And show no love for any feral cats. 
To see it only matter user friendly, 
Or fresh too busy eating pretty rats ! 
Are you not gonna wear that royal jelly. 
[NEWLINE]
I never ever really wanna pet, 
Or even know how many other pigeons ! 
My baby gotta million dollar vet ! 
She had an empty pocket full of kittens. 

Perhaps another money could appear. 
No life for any social mutilation ! 
We know the only thing became unclear, 
But yet within an hour of speculation. 
[NEWLINE]
How many other people contradict, 
This world is really truly highly likely ! 
To see what happened after cherry picked ! 
I often wonder when it seems unlikely. 

Some hungry children having happy cheese ! 
How very merry christmas people greet. 
They offer me so many yellow peas, 
To see this world within my mercy seat. 
[NEWLINE]
It only needs another human bed, 
Or any other sacrificial meat ! 
We need another chocolate soda bread, 
And then the air is really slightly sweet. 

And hundred double slit experiment ! 
His little body started getting lit ! 
It even better whether you transparent, 
Or any brother gotta double slit. 
[NEWLINE]
This early morning sun is shining brightly, 
With glowing bodies under golden light ! 
Who wanna ever wonder god almighty ! 
How many other human thoughts excite. 

Not knowing very many chorus ich. 
But when each day becomes an open letter, 
This year continues after season mich ! 
And dazzled by an old soprano tenor. 
[NEWLINE]
Some people worship only germans bien, 
They know their social life is like a staat ! 
We need a little peace forever mein ! 
I wanna follow where my children gott. 

Entire human second care provider ! 
Is running through this very final master ! 
Has risen from an old cathedral choir, 
No longer frightened by the vice commander. 
[NEWLINE]
I really wanna join my own position, 
For giving me another happy meeting ! 
Too many people living on commission, 
With thoughts of any other teams competing. 

With most amazing secret mystic river ! 
How many hollow rivers travel steep ! 
A hundred thousand million mountains nearer, 
Than any ocean river running deep. 
[NEWLINE]
And climb an open road to west terrain, 
Or wander through another shady lane ! 
No one surrounded by an awful plain, 
This very pretty little mountain chain. 

Not living under such marine pollution. 
My own potential new stability, 
No room to any logical conclusion, 
An endless thunderstorm activity. 
[NEWLINE]
Is something like a nuclear attack ! 
I wanna know about the climate change ! 
It offers me another service pack ! 
We only need an open key exchange. 

It started getting pretty very sewn ! 
I could remember drinking rubber ball, 
But when my head was slowly being thrown. 
And like a million dollar curtain wall. 
[NEWLINE]
With tinted windows over sliding doors ! 
Or seven hundred fifty thousand feet, 
A billion horses under marble floors ! 
Too many people from the big backseat. 

Larry davis versus tommy perry. 
And mister gary bobby sally eddie, 
My daddy johnny sister darling becky ! 
My mommy Mister baby kitty betty. 
[NEWLINE]
Oh mrs. linda norma jean mckenzie, 
It kinda strange how you behaving badly ! 
So very lovely mary pretty debbie ! 
Or nothing like an english lady stanley. 

And see how many other folks are trading ! 
They only carry any armour plate. 
It even matter whether cable laying, 
Or foot or under heavy water freight. 
[NEWLINE]
No way i ever could admit defeat, 
That you have given me a sailing ship ! 
Surrounded by my own atlantic fleet ! 
I bought an empty pocket battleship. 

Can you not even bother paying rent ! 
My middle name is Mister arts degree. 
With seven hundred dollars ten percent, 
He needs another dollar entry fee. 
[NEWLINE]
Some people wanna wage discrimination, 
They try to use an evil inclination ! 
No need for unemployment compensation, 
Or any other way of job creation. 

For only one collective memory ! 
Who try to wait until today is great ! 
We know that something truly legendary, 
Are gonna vanish from this tragic fate. 
[NEWLINE]
Remember when the world has cleared away ! 
What you create a lasting legacy ! 
Not even having life expressed dismay, 
Or maybe very happy being merry. 

So real as any person could rely, 
Can use a most entire public sector, 
And only human action may apply ! 
These little skills are never gonna render. 
[NEWLINE]
I know the lack of knowledge very rarely, 
Or even care about what you create ! 
It really does not necessarily, 
A common move and you manipulate. 

Entire knuckles started crashing slashing ! 
And children watched with little fingers tied ! 
How many human minds are barely glancing, 
Too busy telling me to move aside. 
[NEWLINE]
My hands were big enough for even stating ! 
Was such a puppet on an ugly stick ! 
Another small idea at the taking, 
Or maybe doing something very quick. 

For most entire human labour party. 
This world political philosophy ! 
I know some very foreign policy, 
They may create their own equality. 
[NEWLINE]
How many other people getting freer, 
Is there no promised land or constitution ! 
Who cares about a public labour leader ! 
We never really need an institution. 

To echo through the golden gates of san. 
They offer me a mondo generator, 
Un hombre como ella por el gran ! 
An ancient boca like a holy savior. 
[NEWLINE]
The los an only son d angelo, 
Dios dias contra este pollo ! 
No saber nada ni geronimo, 
Or pero alli entre viva bravo. 

Electric vocals over harry larry. 
Oh daddy baby sister cousin terry, 
For mister david number danny ferry ! 
Or any angel calling Mister eddie. 
[NEWLINE]
So sad to see the other side of jerry ! 
I never saw an english racing driver, 
That dirty sticky lovely lady sherri ! 
She had a pretty little cherry wilder. 

To see that nothing could become unwise. 
This one is written on the status quo, 
But when some people try to compromise ! 
They might expect an answer even though. 
[NEWLINE]
Not there no matter whether fully willing, 
Or having such a very special stance ! 
So many major brothers from submitting ! 
We never really had a second chance. 

So many people by the cheapest way, 
Who never even needed any brakes ! 
They started running under newport bay. 
No one was really only funnel cakes. 
[NEWLINE]
She never had another muscle car ! 
I guess i thought it took delivery ! 
A very little karaoke bar, 
To see the world designed specifically. 

And judy reproduced without permission ! 
United by collective federation ! 
Or even try with criminal conviction, 
Or even vote for profit corporation. 
[NEWLINE]
We had a greater moral obligation, 
Has no-one ever thought about protection ! 
I never really needed compensation. 
No need to use an inner intervention. 

For being driven by survival guide, 
And people looking at their own reports, 
This very little magic ferry ride ! 
They wear a disney animated shorts. 
[NEWLINE]
No one is there too many witness statements, 
Not even any evidence supporting ! 
A hundred thousand million secret agents, 
Human business while police are hawking. 

Da era la fiesta del peru, 
De casa esta via costa rica ! 
A toda tu camino auto coup ! 
Un hombre para esta argentina. 
[NEWLINE]
A como una spanish empire, 
En cada mano mas afghanistan. 
El culpa entre nelson rockefeller, 
No soy un nuevo dia una gran. 

We gotta see computer animation ! 
They wanna mona lisa polly ann. 
I know this visual hallucination, 
Are getting better Mister bearded man. 
[NEWLINE]
Its coming from the very narrow angle ! 
It puts a new performance on display, 
To never ever read an alpha channel, 
What happens when my world is turning gray. 

Another number one decision making, 
A new entire public policy ! 
The system also needs awareness raising ! 
To use their chemistry biology. 
[NEWLINE]
A million dollars from an old addition. 
They never asked for profit corporation, 
But you were only working on commission ! 
We had so many workers compensation. 

Too many people getting glued together ! 
What happens when this woman molded plastic ! 
Has given me an imitation leather, 
To add a little something like elastic. 
[NEWLINE]
I only wanna see my sugar cane ! 
I never need another solid phase, 
Or heavy paper plastic cellophane ! 
Is nothing like electric water sprays. 

A very really sterile population, 
Too busy living fifty years or older. 
It causes unemployment compensation ! 
Not given one formaldehyde exposure. 
[NEWLINE]
For ever gonna wage discrimination ! 
An only second owner occupied, 
Or try to use my highest concentration, 
Or simply also self identified. 

And sing this old equipment corporation ! 
Her mother wears another pontiac. 
His husband sits upon an ancient dayton, 
He drives my little yellow cadillac. 
[NEWLINE]
I wanna know how many happy days ! 
Who could remember any thunder bay, 
Or mary george or michael reuben hayes ! 
Not like to hear the words of marvin gaye. 

Deliver any penetration rates ! 
We gotta mighty global trading floor ! 
And babies running over summer eights, 
For counting germans at their highest score. 
[NEWLINE]
A hundred billion nations highest earning, 
Are only children making honor roll ! 
I hope to see the very hardest working ! 
Is coming from an early reader poll. 

Looking back and see what happened chea ! 
I know that you have any weaker notion, 
We ever really need for delta t ! 
So many girls are moving under motion. 
[NEWLINE]
They try to use their very own position. 
Or taken by kinetic energy, 
Or such a mathematical description, 
It never does not necessarily. 

Not even being Mister irish nanny. 
But there is never ever gonna chop, 
That funny mother pretty silly granny ! 
No any shopping at a pizza shop. 
[NEWLINE]
Are you too busy eating turkey steak ! 
And offer me another kitchen floor, 
Or rather use some extra better bake, 
Or big enough to fill my dresser drawer. 

To human beings being imitating, 
No need for any second william gibson. 
Too busy hearing other critics praising, 
It going on with those poetic diction. 
[NEWLINE]
The number one divine vocabulary ! 
Has given me a major inspiration, 
My very own artistic legacy ! 
So many lessons from an imitation. 

Not even human having toxic gas ! 
Or being followed by my persian fleet. 
I wanna see an endless solar mass, 
Heaven under any hundred feet. 
[NEWLINE]
This planet earth divided equally, 
No one and there is nothing like the majors ! 
I know how many physical graffiti, 
Who cares about a forty hundred acres. 

They never even answer any pleas ! 
But there is nothing like a prison sentence. 
No longer need to carry legal fees, 
Or work against uncovered evidence. 
[NEWLINE]
We gonna join this modern day probation ! 
I wanna hear an extra statement saying, 
For little Mister tucker corporation ! 
No two or one too many people paying. 

For very many famous holy days, 
And early morning public holiday ! 
We may not even public holidays ! 
I know about another martyrs day. 
[NEWLINE]
What else is there expecting me to swap, 
With only one exclusive interview. 
He sits upon an open corner shop ! 
The other side of seventh avenue. 

Some people never saw a goofy movie, 
Who thought this world is highly animated. 
They asking me how many susan lucci, 
I know it really happen syndicated. 
[NEWLINE]
Not even care for second intermission ! 
No film or any other studio ! 
Perhaps we could discover science fiction, 
And try to watch another movie show. 

To use another public policy ! 
I know about an english former chairman. 
Is better like advanced technology, 
Than any action nor disease prevention. 
[NEWLINE]
But never ever practicing attorney ! 
No matter whether mass psychology, 
Or either kings or bremen germany, 
We also need marine biology. 

I never could remember seventeen, 
Some very silly little punk guitar ! 
He laughed and then became another teen. 
They started acting like a shooting star. 
[NEWLINE]
Too many people ready steady go, 
We knew that you were only keeping score ! 
No one was gonna join this studio ! 
Not being followed by a dinah shore. 

We might not really care about starvation. 
No person ever gonna suffocate ! 
They know that spiritual transformation, 
Is making crazy babies being ate. 
[NEWLINE]
Their idle minds are very busy thrashing, 
So happy eating chicken food supplies ! 
The one who may allow an army snatching, 
To use a thousand other human cries. 

Would also rather simply see below, 
This simple focus on an open phrase ! 
And nothing ever happens even though, 
They know a hundred thousand million ways. 
[NEWLINE]
No one can any longer care unlike, 
That you are such a very great extreme ! 
I try to see what others may dislike ! 
I only feel as though it do not seem. 

Is where the tiny giant coloured snakes, 
Are lying naked under rubber sandals ! 
She spreads his fingers over leather steaks, 
And never even swallow wooden handles. 
[NEWLINE]
He touches me with greasy finger nails. 
My little finger on this super glide ! 
Who needs to wear too many chicken tails ! 
I wanna see another body dyed. 

Traditions on their bloody hands were nearly. 
And when a little word became restored, 
For any human ankle injury ! 
No other way too many people scored. 
[NEWLINE]
Not taken from what you already gave, 
My heart was broken even though i tried ! 
It had become a such mistake to save, 
Or ever fought or ever brushed aside. 

Can you remember being robert smalls ! 
How many other local central mall, 
And germans at the largest shopping malls ! 
I know this one is really very small. 
[NEWLINE]
We need an only care facility ! 
Are you not even any urban planning, 
Or never ever see another philly ! 
My body spinning rapidly expanding. 

It sounded like an automatic bid ! 
Some people gotta die for something new, 
That only entered through an empty mid, 
With twenty seven hundred dollars due. 
[NEWLINE]
They handed me a thousand letters from ! 
Too many years of going over though ! 
Not gonna wait to see what you become ! 
My life was taken from the studio. 

Who never even noticed anything. 
This life not going any longer quite ! 
And when an old idea everything, 
Would linger on an early morning might. 
[NEWLINE]
A very merry christmas everybody ! 
Is there so many other people merely, 
To know that you was feeling very sorry, 
But baby please remember me sincerely. 

To justify this final disposition ! 
I wanna know my very own decision. 
I see some people die without conviction, 
Or fear no longer human rights commission. 
[NEWLINE]
Not even any other rule applies, 
The black police are calling me obscene ! 
A nation under pressure on chastise ! 
We need another new dispute between. 

I know what you expect an equal pay ! 
Is such a major public policy, 
That only needs another sandra day ! 
Not never ever owning property. 
[NEWLINE]
Or any other little people caring, 
And children also hope against addictions ! 
Are being tested by genetic testing ! 
The power under felony convictions. 

With verbal mathematical expressions ! 
Who offered me the second pocket guide, 
Or paul mccartney versus larry evans ! 
We started making bodies loosely tied. 
[NEWLINE]
I had an extra mental attitude, 
To move within my own vocabulary. 
How many people drink organic food ! 
They never really need l hennessy. 

Not ever really winning re election, 
Or any other single resident ! 
Too many people like appointed chairman, 
To travel under heavy flight lieutenant. 
[NEWLINE]
No one is being tested by commission ! 
Depending on my little army ranger. 
I know this new profession politician, 
Has given me an answer from the mayor. 

Is gonna stay another distance runner ! 
That fifty million dollar palace coup, 
With extra money over silver slugger ! 
For seven hundred quarter after two. 
[NEWLINE]
No orders from an only youngest player, 
So full of one who cares about the stakes ! 
To meet another little buddy baker, 
But nothing never ever really breaks. 

Who watches any other woman throws, 
Or see her very lovely face she wears ! 
What happened after tony mary goes, 
Is resting on so many lonely stares. 
[NEWLINE]
An empty window slowly hangs himself. 
But even though his music gently weeps ! 
The only thing he ever threw herself, 
Or wonder where this torture never keeps. 

They never even wanna walk away. 
Was wrong but nothing ever figured out, 
Why bother letting other children play ! 
No use too busy worrying about. 
[NEWLINE]
I know exactly where it could begin, 
An awful day for giving me a spend ! 
Not write another song or play or win, 
Another letter never gonna send. 

Can you consider any other norm ! 
Each day as though it may become appealing. 
To follow through another quiet storm, 
But there is such an easy thing achieving. 
[NEWLINE]
Its only human musical express, 
And nothing ever gonna move away ! 
We know how many people chart success ! 
They never see the latest double jay. 

Surrounded by relationship between ! 
It never could become another yin, 
This place that any soul has ever seen, 
A spirit like awakened from within. 
[NEWLINE]
To focus on an old melodic line ! 
Some people know not necessarily. 
Or when the other way is real divine, 
Within my very own vocabulary. 

A hundred thousand million miles away, 
It only needs another solar gain ! 
To hear this very special bounty bay ! 
I wanna see another new terrain. 
[NEWLINE]
We need an early morning hurricanes. 
And there not even changing surface texture, 
Or any wonder where the winter rains, 
It never changes under stormy weather. 

An angry little bloody situation, 
What on the hell are you concerned about ! 
Not being under cross contamination ! 
I wanna spend another day without. 
[NEWLINE]
This very final inner isolation, 
A human mind becomes unnecessary. 
Have taken such an easy way to hasten, 
Or need my actions handled carefully. 

Without environmental policy, 
Or being followed by magnetic boards, 
With any new decision making body ! 
Or through an endless influenced awards. 
[NEWLINE]
No one can hear a voice of adoration. 
This song is written on electric chairs ! 
My heart has given me an invitation, 
For me to see the greatest love affairs. 

To ever catch another final ora. 
It never even matter penny taylor, 
No one is gonna win this super hora ! 
I gotta million dollar fighter trainer. 
[NEWLINE]
A new entire russian federation, 
For giving me the bloody coup d tat ! 
We need a pocket full of sovereign patron ! 
My little brother mister postman pat. 

They might have given me the fortune teller, 
To see another communist aggression ! 
No one was only visiting professor ! 
I never even wanted former chairman. 
[NEWLINE]
Not yet too busy making morris hunt ! 
An overall responsibility, 
Or nothing on a patriotic front ! 
My life is like a boston symphony. 

For being like an english punk musician. 
Oh jimmy danny brother johnny andy ! 
The backing vocals judy dennis wilson, 
My poppa billy harry cindy randy. 
[NEWLINE]
My very pretty baby daddy debbie ! 
A crazy song about anita baker, 
A mona lisa mister bobby terry ! 
I really wanna marry derek taylor. 

So many mothers ever gotta quit, 
They may have seen his mother nature throw. 
And then an angry tiny little bit ! 
It sounded like a very happy show. 
[NEWLINE]
As though my broken heart was gonna make ! 
No other day would happen anyway, 
For giving me another lucky break ! 
I could remember when he walked away. 

For doing something very similar. 
And then i feel so busy thinking feeling ! 
A very second person singular, 
To any other person spanish speaking. 
[NEWLINE]
A thousand years of nuclear decay, 
Are spoken by the younger generations ! 
I know it really happens everyday, 
Or even under english speaking nations. 

Too many bbc obituary, 
Who ever needed internet e mail ! 
I bought an early bible dictionary ! 
He only had another bad email. 
[NEWLINE]
Their pictures under empty picture frames. 
And blinded by the internet connection, 
With those official parker brothers games, 
Or whom they need for copyright protection. 

Can never post apocalyptic fiction. 
Or maybe only yesterday today ! 
Too busy sitting at nebraska lincoln, 
And getting money over alan kay. 
[NEWLINE]
A little military strategy, 
To join my very own biology ! 
Another human plant anatomy, 
The world with positive psychology. 

Another hundred million dollar baking ! 
They know how many people smoking lye. 
No matter whether human barrel aging, 
Or any diamond under yellow dye. 
[NEWLINE]
We work together like banana mortar, 
My money coming through recycled paper, 
The juices melting over soda water ! 
I wanna add a little nutty flavor. 

They never even gotta dirty lick ! 
Some super orange leather vertical, 
That pretty tiny rusty yellow brick. 
Im going over heavy traffic circle. 
[NEWLINE]
Around this place my middle finger stacking, 
Is where we gonna carry fifty feet ! 
I wanna see another circle packing, 
And looking back upon a parish seat. 

To see no other bug compatible, 
We know that mother dinner pole position ! 
Its only second user manual, 
My father likes to fill his brief description. 
[NEWLINE]
The pain of being followed by e mail. 
And then another silly little foo ! 
Who cares about a very bad email ! 
What happens when he really wears a moo. 

So many people random limitation. 
They know that most entire sole selection ! 
Has given any price discrimination, 
For any certain absolute perfection. 
[NEWLINE]
To use a hundred thousand carat weight, 
I never thought we could identify ! 
The shape of such a daily error rate ! 
The human system does not satisfy. 

That itty bitty little maple neck ! 
We gonna rock another motor car ! 
Not making any better double deck, 
Than Mister local karaoke bar. 
[NEWLINE]
Or playing music by my stereo. 
I gotta forty million vocal lessons ! 
This hundred billion dollar motor show, 
To cover me with heavy turbo engines. 

Its only one performance penalty ! 
How many triple dos protected mode, 
As though this world is very secondary. 
They try to carry such a heavy load. 
[NEWLINE]
I know no matter where it ever may, 
But you have never seen an empty stack ! 
I travel under holy java se ! 
My heart has given me a service pack. 

Who ever bought another poor ho chunk, 
Dirty muddy river buffalo ! 
We never even carried any skunk ! 
But lord have mercy on my little beau. 
[NEWLINE]
I know that holy northern south dakota ! 
Whose name was lifted under orange pine, 
Across his mobile home to oklahoma. 
He had a golden velvet porcupine. 

Would rather add an extra statement saying ! 
Can you believe what others talked about ! 
And though these other words are barely stating, 
Or nothing ever really pointing out. 
[NEWLINE]
They may not even bother saying pun ! 
The world is such a very simple phrase, 
This story watches over everyone ! 
We need another song to sing and praise. 

How many human beings may arise ! 
A greater social legal definition, 
Than any other person satisfies, 
A false distinction by their own condition. 
[NEWLINE]
No earthly actions spoken otherwise ! 
A very little comma category ! 
This vicious form of human flesh denies, 
The truth within the vast majority. 

Them other girls are getting ready ooh, 
Or yet too busy starting quarterback ! 
They gotta very little wrecking crew, 
Who had so many people running back. 
[NEWLINE]
For any second chapter after show. 
This song is going on an old guitar ! 
Can you remember where we gonna go ! 
I wanna see a super superstar. 

For seven hundred thousand forty tons ! 
They offered me another place to rest, 
So many people washed away with guns ! 
An older life no longer feel possessed. 
[NEWLINE]
It often felt a little crushed and battered, 
But something really had already slipped. 
I could remember when his hands were scattered, 
Until a brother had completely shipped. 

To judge the longest serving senator ! 
I need another nazi persecution. 
Im sorry Mister david rockefeller, 
With freedom from the hoover institution. 
[NEWLINE]
Not even any other spinal cancer, 
A hundred million members also passive ! 
How you become an actor singer dancer ! 
Too many people being very active. 

Not yet too busy selling sushi bars ! 
Or walking through that private pizza parlor. 
I saw an orange wagon rolled cigars, 
And you remember Mister yellow farmer. 
[NEWLINE]
How could they really try to tickle me ! 
I started running from his tailor shop, 
For twenty fifty dollar company, 
Was only such a little barbershop. 

An hour or heaven at another shrine. 
Too many people sharing christmas praying ! 
Is something really truly great divine, 
I hope to see supreme decision making. 
[NEWLINE]
But nothing causes constant meditation, 
For any modern day abomination ! 
So glad we had a little celebration, 
Blessings from an ancient revelation. 

Has done an awful major sample rate ! 
Of those who could afford his wedding fee ! 
No one can any longer calculate, 
It really happened very quickly g. 
[NEWLINE]
Was written by an adam ordered pair, 
He had too many people counting k ! 
They know the only thing we ever share, 
Is going on and never gonna pay. 

How many people gonna marry larry, 
That television personality ! 
This one was really pleased to meet my sherri, 
But no-one ever saw an island sandy. 
[NEWLINE]
She had a very pretty little sassy ! 
The only internet celebrity ! 
Is also robert thomas tommy sammy, 
And charlie wilson versus matthew perry. 

And Mister mister western knight commander, 
So you can hear this very distant sender ! 
That dirty little spooky little banker, 
About a hundred billion dollar member. 
[NEWLINE]
He offers me a double polo player. 
I know my only brother shirley jackson ! 
Is there not even any boxing trainer ! 
I need another number one medallion. 

Another fallen angel heaven sent ! 
I knew this life was really worth believing ! 
What any others ever thought it meant, 
That you would offer me completely seeking. 
[NEWLINE]
A million reasons helping me pursue ! 
About the secret dreams we never vowed, 
Or trade an extra room for something new ! 
And even there is nothing yet allowed. 

Is living like a daily rocket miner. 
We had another million dollar member, 
But there was only seven douglas wilder ! 
This little lady named us senator. 
[NEWLINE]
An international relations scholar, 
For me to see my brother mary ellen ! 
A friend with uncle john and frank o connor ! 
The latest music on committee chairman. 

No shelter from another single yin. 
My thoughts are guided by eternal greed ! 
Their greatest journey through this land of sin, 
They may not even hope or any deed. 
[NEWLINE]
Some people see what causes deprivation, 
To challenge me against the malted grain ! 
Which one is only human motivation ! 
A little life or on an astral plane. 

This very total passive opposition ! 
Not having any civil labor party ! 
I know how many greedy minds have risen, 
To add another public policy. 
[NEWLINE]
Or ten percent majority opinion ! 
A ruling nation under voting rights, 
People killing human rights commission, 
For human beings there are only whites. 

Milky way to garner state bodega. 
It started swinging under cypress tree ! 
They entered home victoria australia, 
His name was calling from the captain z. 
[NEWLINE]
He had an angry midget submarine, 
I know that you were really sleeping te ! 
We gotta tiny little trampoline, 
With very little orange soda pee. 

Being sickened by each other reaching. 
But nothing really cares about today ! 
Are you so busy standing there competing, 
Who knew how many people moved away. 
[NEWLINE]
For any very moment you rebuild, 
Or even any second needs replacing ! 
This year is such an easy way to build ! 
A story where no one was only playing. 

Becoming quickly having easy using. 
No one can really even concentrate ! 
For only words we ever finished choosing, 
Or helping those pathetic thoughts create. 
[NEWLINE]
And yet the sound is getting longer quite, 
I feel their simple minds continue proving ! 
Its daily senses slowly moving tight ! 
The shifting forms extremely time consuming. 

Or maybe only seven tower dot ! 
Or even wonder when this multi chip, 
Has ever taken any second slot ! 
It serves to fill an orange paper clip. 
[NEWLINE]
I bought a pocket full of nickel silver, 
With razor blade extended vocal cords. 
She puts the needle through a little zipper, 
And you forget about the secret boards. 

Their very own entire service pack ! 
Not giving you another organ donor, 
Or rather wander through an empty stack ! 
No wonder where my memory controller. 
[NEWLINE]
I play with inner felony conviction, 
Any lyric Mister hover hear ! 
The sound of people need to seek permission. 
So please consider me a vocal tier. 

Are gonna travel under laser light ! 
They causing me commitment therapy, 
To tell how many human minds excite, 
This very little heart of eden prairie. 
[NEWLINE]
Who needs a total sample preparation ! 
I know the world is getting faster quicker ! 
We gotta global motion compensation ! 
I wanna see another reflex mirror. 

I never ever wanna see another, 
So many empty lines are unified. 
We need remote control and do not stutter ! 
An ocean full of human tuning slide. 
[NEWLINE]
These bodies closing over double threes ! 
Im feeling like a partial skeleton, 
To save my soul for giving me the keys ! 
This world is only number one exception. 

To tread above that rocky mountain shore ! 
So many hundred thousand people sowing, 
This song is never ending tidal bore, 
The heavens over winter storms are blowing. 
[NEWLINE]
I feel this crazy roller coaster swarm. 
We float together like a mountain feather ! 
No river flowing under thunder storm ! 
Or any stormy sun or cooler weather. 

Is simply also nothing yet applies. 
We try as major jewish holidays, 
For those who know this world of death arise ! 
Some people travel through so many ways. 
[NEWLINE]
Surrounded by a carbon skeleton ! 
Depending on each others social form ! 
They never use their very own perception, 
Or even any further from the norm. 

En cada contra tu camino del ! 
No este mundo se el salvador. 
Un nuevo esta vida es miguel, 
El amor como sera viva por. 
[NEWLINE]
Oh baby Mister taxi plaza mayor ! 
I need another spanish inquisition, 
To save the very merry curry favour, 
For andy on a touring exhibition. 

Another human soul eliminate ! 
This world is taking over toxic levels, 
For money cause no one can tolerate, 
Pollution causes toxic chemicals. 
[NEWLINE]
Too many people under total danger ! 
We know what any person could protect ! 
Enough to offer you addictive nature, 
Or even really care about affect. 

But nothing ever happens after year ! 
So many minutes temporarily ! 
Or maybe going through an old career, 
Not worse than any other danny ferry. 
[NEWLINE]
No one is really very busy playing, 
And laughing at this little super cup ! 
We see the only thing about replacing ! 
Each day another life has ended up. 

Not even really drinking any lye. 
Some folks are happy couples throwing rice ! 
So many hungry people multiply, 
Too busy dancing on religious mice. 
[NEWLINE]
The one with only seven smiles o c ! 
A way to college cell biology, 
A louis miller brewing company, 
Is going crazy over malted barley. 

That summer love was starring pancho villa ! 
We had this new september argentina ! 
O est en rio hampton roads virginia, 
To paris heather under costa rica. 
[NEWLINE]
Columbus rosa santa cruz de la, 
What kinda little lady named evita, 
An august april over panama ! 
A hundred thousand dollar fort christina. 

No matter there is nothing separating ! 
Its only middle waters interstate. 
I really know that you are barely facing, 
Or even any very narrow strait. 
[NEWLINE]
My eyes have seen so many worlds surrounding ! 
I never see another narrow strip ! 
We travel under residential housing, 
To meet each other by the eastern tip. 

To write another silly magazine ! 
Or maybe Mister mrs. mary ann. 
I wanna tell no uncle hi maxine, 
For any little mona lisa jan. 
[NEWLINE]
And at the early morning jerry springer, 
A very merry christmas larry fine ! 
Who cares about my brother larry miller ! 
His golden hair was wearing roger klein. 

Their very own entire solar cell ! 
Each other human being underwater, 
To nature under giant diving bell ! 
Is there so many people treading water. 
[NEWLINE]
This world reveals another vacuum flask. 
Its burning power like a paper tape, 
And dripping from an iron facial mask ! 
What happens when my heart desired shape. 

For any fully loaded nickel plate, 
But on this very simple circuit breaker ! 
And then we gotta open logic gate ! 
Or slip another pattern generator. 
[NEWLINE]
An empty space between my scuba sets. 
The only reason you communicate, 
About how many other people lets ! 
Its such an easy way to activate. 

As children suffer from departed nations. 
The king of those who never could maintain ! 
They only wanna know about relations, 
Too busy looking at an awful gain. 
[NEWLINE]
I guess how many people had remained ! 
We ever really need no clear distinction, 
To prove that life has yet become maintained ! 
This world is such a privileged position. 

Designed to add another wider sense. 
And then a certain picture spins aligned, 
Than there has ever gonna happen hence ! 
Some people also often feel defined. 
[NEWLINE]
Are spoken by an ancient dialect, 
But most of whom or many sources differ ! 
I know no matter where it may affect ! 
The simple life is very similar. 

A thousand voices calling me unveils, 
No other people under flashing light ! 
Not looking from too many vapor trails ! 
They really wanna see mosquito bite. 
[NEWLINE]
And wander on this very wavy line ! 
My mind has gotten further weakening, 
Surrounded by another neon sign, 
We never even need a little greeting. 

The very hardest thing to comprehend ! 
This story going on without concern, 
Is worse than any person could transcend. 
No one should know or even gotta learn. 
[NEWLINE]
I wanna see a new decision making, 
Each others move and then eliminate ! 
Another other nation from creating ! 
An easy way of making you relate. 

Who ever saw an orange market clearing ! 
Not even having any tennis ball ! 
But then he started drinking skinny dipping, 
And finished playing college basketball. 
[NEWLINE]
His dad were walking over tennis hall, 
To see that hundred thousand eagles mere ! 
This dirty garden little waterfall, 
Another very foggy pleasure pier. 

This very little luxury hotel ! 
I know we could resort to russell majors, 
Or never ever really gonna sell ! 
I even need another hundred acres. 
[NEWLINE]
No orders from department companies, 
And money over Mister kerr mcgee. 
Too busy paying business license fees, 
For giving me a million dollar fee.
