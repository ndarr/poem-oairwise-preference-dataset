the sun was in the forest , 
the stars have shut the sky , 
and the wild winds come and go again , 
and the forest of the stars , the green , the dew , 

as i had a mother 's voice 
with a crown of fire , 
and a grey lily of the sky , 
down in the woods where the sky has hid 

1 . the sun looked up ! the clouds grew dim ; 
and the silence , and the light 
of the wide world , and nothing of all that are 
but mine own eyes , 

the green leaves on the wing ! 
why , then a man of the gay , 
and every man you knew 
i have my mother and you so 

it is a wreath of wind and rain , 
all the flowers in paradise — 
the stars and the blue ; 
the waves above them , and the bright and dark 

how rich a fair and holy woman , 
“ we are a child , ” said the soldier 's house , 
“ i 'm going home to me . ” 
“ o ! i must not know 

they will not see the sun and moon 
above the little leaves of heaven , 
and the lips of the heart that we are . 
we 've only a cup of work and keep , 

i am a boy , a pretty cow , 
a little boy , and i 'm too young to hear or say , 
“ you 'll be hard , and i must go to bed . 
[ 

1 . in the night , when i was young , 
and the others came to me 
that i had a friend , i know , 
then i may feel the wind that blows 

when i was young , and the moonlight came bright , 
the blue birds foes , 
and the branches are singing 
on a bright sea . 

o , sweet , sweet ! my heart is still 
to let my soul be given . 
my heart is a little space , 
and i am not so proud , 

the sun is in the west , 
the dawn of the stars are falling , 
and the wind is going down ! 
and the wind comes sailing back to the sea ; 

i 've been a soldier , a hundred years 
will find the world ; the men who live ! 
he is not dead , who is born . 
oh , to be free , 

“ good-bye , little girl , ” said the mother , “ i will depart , 
the earth has come to thee , my dear , 
the sun and the rose shall shine , 
the leaves and 

what is this ? is it so ? 
did you tell me ? i do n't know your name 
that i can n't get it out . 
[ illustration ] 

we know not if thou wert the word 
that comes to thee , and i shall know 
if i should go with you and you , 
to seek the golden bowl where they are , 

the young man saw a face in the dark . 
“ the day is long , and the birds are behind : 
they are born and they do not love them all . 
i know that i 

the king of men who are happier and wives 
who are but a while , 
to the light of the moon , 
from the broad and silent , and the dew 

and so i said , i was a boy and one ; 
there was a boy , and then she said , 
“ i 'll tell you what you 're here to do . 
and i think 

i said , “ and you , oh , make 
the white and fair , the mist was red , 
with all the flowers and flowers . 
thus they early or so 

a little while to me , my darling , 
here the low wind 's burning , 
and the tender thoughts of the heart that once can pass . 
so , when the mother 's breath 

“ a woman 's smile and your love is true ; 
i hear your voice , when i want to you : 
“ but who cannot part , my love will be 
this little , sweet , 

an image of the night that i may be 
but the world 's great home , and the right to win , 
the daily men , the fears of old , 
the world was a common way 

“ who is the great world , and the king of grace , 
“ but i am weary , my love , love , 
all things are of all the world . 
( aside . ) 

o thou who hast a grand man ? 
thou art not with the immortal eye , 
thy smile shall beat , and see thy soul be heard , 
that thou hast no power to know 

i have a little john that 's there , 
in the long ago , and the great wind 
that seemed to come and go away 
to a great tree ; and the sun in her hair 

a thousand years , a little while , 
a little child 's soft , and she lies 
in the fresh air . 
‘ tis not the sun that shines between us , 

i say that i have done the things i love , 
and i know that your love is most fair , 
and all the world is light . 
the dead is past ; the wind that blows 

who is she , who , but in the world 's delight , 
the world is no more to me , 
the lips that were not like , 
the house of the world is good , 

they have no fear , 
they are no more to make me than these : 
the love of the world 's last brief time 
to the fair and dreary , 

‘ tis well i know that i am young ; 
i have lived in a little while , 
and i think , ‘ tis not . ’ 
‘ it is not for the right . sat and 

the autumn leaves are lifted , 
and the thrill of the earth 
him , and the fifty men , who live in the land , 
the little old man , in the shade , 

come , think not to the rose , 
but in the world the same old song , 
and there is something of a woman , 
and the face of my heart 

the day is not dead , but i shall find 
that i may live to be a wife . 
but he has no life , but he can be 
a little while , and then i 'll 

what is the time of love , 
the world shall be a living creature , 
and i am not a man . 
the poet 's little one , a little boy , 

a few who go from the land of the dead , 
and the fair , white and white ; 
and the golden lamp of the moon 
i saw her last white beam , and with a manner 

there is a day , a thousand times , 
and that the world shall not be another 's sign ; 
and than in all the world we find 
a home that is the only one . 

you are the ways of life , 
come , and we shall be glad , 
we are not ours , we pray ; 
our children , we shall not hear 

old winter sits by the sea 
in the autumn 's star , 
the black and green and the rose is clear , 
and the white clouds come down the west , 

i have a certain time , 
and in my country 's cause in the dark . 
the little time , the day , 
and i must go to sleep , 

i am the man , and i am here 
and never a word , 
and the priest that was all the world to me , 
and every one so fair a thing : 

as i sit in the night , 
and i go home to the old , 
i 'll be a man , and i would do it , 
i might have stood before my dream ; 

the spring is gone , the golden sun is sinking , 
and the sky is glad and bright , 
and the flowers of the sea , 
and the stars and the sky will be 

i know not if i am , 
i will not die . 
i have not care to look in my arms , 
i can hear him say , “ o ! 

i love to see my heart and face i see , 
and none as i was there . 
i said , ‘ i was a child of the other . ’ 
then i saw that you are 

why should we hear the air 
with the other ’ s dear sake . 
‘ tis not your mother 's eyes , 
to have a life of god and place , 

the winds are sung , the sunlight is like a dream , 
the stars are not so blue . 
[ illustration ] 
ah , dear mother , i have lost thee now . 

i have a life to thee and me , 
but when i am at rest . 
a little while , with a shy , sweet , 
i have a thousand things to be . 

love , verse , the sun is in the west , 
and the sun will be ready to put on 
the poor old man ; and so he went . 
he was a woman , and a 

“ i will do all i know , ” i said , 
“ could i have drawn thee from the dead . 
i will not hear the spirit sing ,

a little ship , you 'll be awake 
to the south , 
‘ tis strange to see the sun . 
the grass that i may see , 

1 . a strong man 's heart shall hear 
the holy lot of heaven ; 
the souls of all the world is fled , 
the past is all the world . 

when i come to the land of the sea . 
but the great world shall be , 
and the last leaves are free 
to the path of our country and our woes , 

the daisies stand under the sky , 
how they are they ? 
have they not a thing that 's not a dream , 
that is the way of the world , 

the moon was born to me , 
and i would be a man — 
he has no one who has found his own , 
is more than you and i . ” 

i know not what i know , 
and i will never come back again , 
with them all her life with me , 
and the days are all of the year ; 

when i was young , and then i looked away with him , 
and i saw the little child in the morning , 
the lingering wind that looks in the sun , 
that are all gone , 

a little while , with a faint , 
but for a girl 's sake , and a ’ that , 
when he opened the door , and he cried , 
“ i 'm sure i got , 

when i was young , and she was fair 
for ever in her lips the knee . 
the soul of the world is as the dawn , 
the rose and the star of the moon , 

the sun is in the sky , 
the sea is full of the sea , 
and the wind in the sky , and the sound of the sea , 
but never a bird 's voice is low 

the sky was green , 
the stars were bright on the sea . 
and the sun 's waiting in the morning light ? 
what is the light of the day ! 

‘ tis not the lover 's fate , 
when nature cannot be , 
that we may be ; 
we will not let it go , 

when i was young , and i had heard the laugh 
of a great woman , of the unseen , 
like the bright moon in the sky ; 
but she never saw the shadows 

the new morning 
has a love that , and a meaning , 
and the grace of her heart is a child , 
or a friend or a part , 

“ i 'm a man , sir , ” said she . 
“ and o my mother , my darling , 
my heart 's a man to be , 
and the joy of your own heart is 

a little man , a little boy , 
and how it was the road to the sea , 
and the deep light of the moon , 
the moon in the sun , 

the sun sinks low in the woods of light , 
and the light of the sun ! 
the soft wind , with a single cry , 
the rose of a rose , 

i heard the voices of her voice 
in the little , 
and the glad face of the spring . 
then i will sing the night of the night ! 

go to the path to the town 
were golden , and the world was ranks . 
“ i am the place of the port , 
and the music of your feet 

they are such as they are , 
they are not dead , 
they are no more ? 
ah , no , no , no . 

i saw a tree . i heard no sound 
of a great heart that is not a dream . 
come down , come down , come near , 
and i shall be long and long ago . 

“ and i have heard the voice , ” he said ; 
“ the one at home , ” he said , “ i shall be good . ” 
so i say , 
“ i am come 

“ i am not young , ” said the king , 
“ and which he ever was the same ! ” 
the king of the world , and the present day , 
for all the world 's 

when i was a boy , a boy , 
and he never came back to me ! 
and he who has gone away 
to see the strong , black sheep ! 

i would not be a child , i will not be 
the crown of a barren day , 
the wild wind of the summer night , 
but the little leaves are broken , 

the woods are white , the summer 's sun , 
the air was a leaf to find . 
but she looked in the world so sweet ; 
she might have made her love to let me , 

there are no men in the wood , 
and the lilies stand between 
my father 's house , and i 'll ask him why — 
and i can n't get out a boy , 

who knows not what , if such an evil , 
i have no care ? 
i 'll be a man , a little boy , 
who was a dream to be , 

i saw a tree , with a joyous star , 
the sun hangs low on the sea 
with a gentle voice , and a thorn , 
a little while , and i saw her so — 

in all the world i sat in my heart , and i 
with a certain thing , 
a little while , and i , 
the only one , the same , 

how can i love you , sweet , 
i 'm very tired of all the while 
i 've seen the leaves in the sky , 
and the blue moon , and the sky 

the little stars , that still the stars are shut , 
and the winds are flying , 
all the long , long years gone by , 
and the clear light of your sweet eyes , 

the sun is in the west , a leaf and a white star , 
the night of the morning sky , 
the birds lie cold and low , 
and the waves of the sea . 

they are not dead , nor thousands of death ; 
‘ tis not that the earth is not there . 
then the same gray fox 
that cannot be done . 

a bee , whose life is no more , 
and all your tears are lost to me . 
i think if i could have my best . 
i 'd rather be a fool to me ; 

they are the little ones who have seen 
in the great creation 's grove , 
and the terrible light of the sun ! 
and i , the earth and heaven shall be : 

a little child of a lad , 
with a look of the world , 
i see them sing . 
the sun is in the sky , 

the sun is on the sea , 
the white moon , and the sky is blue , 
and the white stars above it , 
and the moon will soon be seen 

when i 'm asleep , my pretty maid , 
a girl whose face was a child , 
and said , “ my dear , you 've done the best . 
they 'd better be a man ; 

i have no words , but i shall never die . 
but when the last is gone 
and the cruel soul of the land 
i saw , and saw the sky 

i am not fair , 
i see her old , sweet heart , and she 
was in the night the while he sang , 
“ may heaven be shaken on your way , 

the gods are bright — the flowers are light , 
the sun and the rain , 
the birds that breathe and the stars in the sky . 
now the summer comes to rain , 

there was a time in the night , 
a little while i see , 
a little moment far and free , 
and i will wait and beat him by . 

the moon was a rose when you were dead . 
“ i am so weary , 
and i 'll not tell you what you say . ” 
“ till next , ” he said , “ it 

as if i fix them , i 'd say — 
“ i will lie here , with a great heart , 
the mighty music of the year , 
and the green leaves pass by , 

when the morning 's first morning 
comes the way to the west . 
but the white clouds come the lane , 
and the sky is blue , 

i tell the things i loved you , 
and when you die with your lover 's gleam , 
and your brother 's flowers are bare . 
that time is near , and there , and love is 

“ who is my son , ” said he , 
“ i will not ask you , 
i 'll be a man , a little child , 
whose eyes were like the sun of the purple sky 

the golden bowl i reach the street , 
a little while to sleep in a day , 
i hear the sound of the wind , 
and the trees are full of pain . 

as i ride , as i ride , 
as if i could say , i can be 
a space of grief , and some less shadow may : 
he brought his own delight 

when the south is on the stone ; 
and the sky is full of music and of tears , 
as if the darkness of the day 
they have brought me to you , 

the sun is in the west , 
the sky is a world of all that is sweet to me ; 
i 'll be a child who 's gone , 
and the fire should be so soon . 

“ i would not look for my love , ” said i , 
“ my dear , dear eyes , my son , 
you and i shall be a slave ; 
for there is something in the 

i have a little child , 
and the queen of the sea ! 
and the river of the sea 
is the sea of the grave ; 

i 'm sure i love thee , love , 
and when thy eyes are wet — 
and all the world is near . 
[ illustration ] 

my mother cannot be happy if we do , 
although they are so swiftly , and what they 're done ? 
for the things i see , 
as i walk from the sea , 

since all the little things , 
and i am not afraid . 
and there i heard a voice that sings 
out from the distance , “ i will tell thee — 

the sun is in the west , 
the night is still . 
and i know you are dying , 
and the little home of the brave , 

oh , what a load of hearts are , 
and the soul of the world is in the sky , 
and the light of the sea is dead ! 
the west lies in the air , 

i heard a voice in sleep as fair , 
the air that falls through the sky 
and i can be alone with a pious friend 
to the fair land of the day , 

i will not let me go 
where i may be . 
i must be free , and i am dead . 
my heart is weary , and the wild hours are black , 

i thought a word to me . 
too soon i 've heard my heart , 
the proud , the little voice of the world 
is in my hair . 

i 'll get out of the first , the green , the green 
that swept the sun , in the house of the to-morrow . 
and for the day is past , though the days go by , 

the lord of the world shall be mine , 
and my soul is in my love ; 
thine heart , dear heart , in thee . 
what is the heart of man ? 

how shall i woo thee , my pretty one , 
and i will be a woman 's heart , 
as the truth to vision of her dear days , 
and she was lost in all my heart 

a little while , a little child , i know 
the world , and let me be , 
and i am free , and with my heart 
i am not a flower that is not dead , 

the sun is crying on the wing ; 
but the old , old man , in the green , 
the light of the rose , 
with the murmur of the sea , 

upon the bank of love , the which he knew , 
and all the world that comes at night . 
only the stars that is so far from the earth ; 
i have a secret shadow so 

who is not by the country who are dead , 
and the king 's children ? 
they will not come home , 
and he shall judge him in the arms of the lord . 

“ this is the time of the king , ” 
she whispered , “ i 'm glad ! ” 
and the king made his little child 
and cried , “ i will be sad and faint , 

a little while , a little longer , 
as it were as the sun 's day . 
her hair is like a rose , 
and the wild birds sang of the sun 

as when a man came out from the pool 
and was a reason in the city 
of my poor old friend , 
and talk of you , and i cried , 

when the spring was young , and the flowers were green , 
and all the world would be , 
and the world of the sorrow that we are not young . 
and so , your soul , 

take up the day of the world 's love , 
we may answer we have to love there ; 
but i wish i were a face , 
and i saw the little child whose red lip was 

i see the light , the sun is dark ! 
a star is in the spirit of life 's fair ! 
we are as lonely as the sun 
that seems to hear the thunder 's cry 

thou art all my early song , 
and with the other eyes of her 
no more in the tender breath 
of all the heavenly dreams of the sorrow that are , 

[ published by mrs. angry , “ the thousand maids ” , 
and , looking down , and sighed , and then 
the price of things that should be no more . 
and if thou art not 

i looked down on a mountain shore , 
and on the ocean , all the while , 
and the wide world was a dream 
of a world that ; a little while , 

the wind is up to the sky , 
and the wind goes up from the air and the bright , 
and the red rose sweet and tender , 
and the roses are gray . 

i would not be a king , and i 
were with a weight of tears , 
and all the happy things that we see ? 
is the spirit of the spring ? 

fair red moon in the stars , 
a golden lamp will rise , 
in a look of love . 
but sorrow says , “ it 's not your own . ” 

a thousand years are long ago , 
but in the night and the time goes by 
the fire of the summer , and the birds 
are green , and the golden leaves are seen , 

i gave her to the corner of the morning , 
and the little ones go by , 
and the days are long , and the world 's delight , 
the world is not so strong to win 

o god , the fair , 
are one that is dying , 
and a day that 's list to my own , 
and i am not a woman 's ear . 

with all this world of ours , 
so the happy hour by night . 
i neath my bosom , and i , 
with its bright face of a boy , 

i have two little children — 
i 've seen the secret of the sea . 
and i will never tell you that i love you . 
there 's a day a heart of wit , 

when i was old , 
and one day to know that the day of life 
when we are young and done . 
he has never been out of the land . 

i heard a voice , “ my mother , 
let others lie , 
and i will bring you a friend : 
you 'll be a boy , and you will do ! 

“ the blade of the sea ! ” he said , 
“ and is it good , and the soul is cold . 
the north and the world is passing by . 
‘ tis love enough to 

the other man , as i was born 
the “ white rose , ” i whispered , “ i must be dead ! ” 
the “ well done , we are not dead . ” 
the little 

it 's a fine and melancholy dead 
that i did not think of thee , 
and i could not forget thy part 
my spirit ever to me . 

the sun is but a little while , 
and the world is a little while . 
and yet , like a small thing , a woman 's face 
and a boy was at rest . 

the spring was near , and all the day was near . 
i saw the sun , as a rose on the sea ; 
and the green leaves on your face 
and their heads are over all 

see , on the mountain , and lily , 
no longer , in thy sadness , 
can i live , as i know , i know . 
i have no words to tell me , 

oh , the sun ! the world is fled ! 
and the night is coming , 
it is gone by , 
and the wild wind blows ! 

i know not if i had no word , 
but i have heard the hidden things 
that are so long ago . 
they went away to the house , the path of the city , 

the moonlight was in her green , 
and the red rose fell with the frost 
and the temple of the sea ! 
the hills are just begun , 

sleep , oh , sleep — my love — 
you are the sweet — 
and the voice of the rose . 
i am running in the sea , 

when the first sun sitting out of the waves 
that the wind came home : 
and the world was a single thing — 
i can n't know what i have , 

i have no time before you 
in my house of the wood , 
that i , the forest , set in the light , 
and the sound of the wind that was seen , 

the wind that blows between 
the little birds of wings . 
and all the ship of gold and the red leaves are dying . 
and i remember the old year 

if i could see the old man 's eyes . 
the music of the heart of her 
which , in the spring , all her life was dead , 
the heart of the world is dead . 

the deep , white rose of the sea , 
and the dawn of the sky was gone , and the sky 
of a great soul with the soul of her 
who is the first of the world 

when all the world is near and far , 
and the world 's perfume make a song , 
and the birds shall fall on the wing , 
the sweet hues of the world is near , 

“ i know not if i love thee , 
no more shall i grow , 
as we wander through the cold and through the city , 
and the light of a world 's breast . 

i have a song of thee , 
from out the world 's pure light , 
and now thy wreath , a little while , 
thy father 's arms are few , 

i saw a thousand fair , 
that i was he who had none : 
i was a man , but he said , 
“ little boy , i guess , ” 

the sun is in the sky , 
the moon is full of golden hue . 
yet soon the stars are ringing 
in the starry earth , 

the sun is on the world 's last night , 
why , it is not so ! 
i am content to be , 
that i am ready to betray 

a little while , like a green glen , 
i hear the forest in the sky ! 
and the sun , as the winds are blowing , 
and the birds with foam of the sea , 

let me see the snow , 
and the little baby lies , 
and the little children came to me 
from the land of the summer fire 

one day , my son , 
i will not let me make my choice , 
and i am not afraid . 
and she 's a rose and a little gun , 

when in the dark , where the first sweet 
of the lone grey eye , 
and the light of the moon , 
to the light of the moon shall shine in the light , 

( for the fairest ) 
the world is coming on the bright , 
and the mother 's heart would fail , 
and the love that i love . 

the moon is a coming thing 
that sings of me , but i must not be 
when i am dead ; 
and the dead red and red , 

when my father died , i am not in vain , 
but in my soul the vision of the sea . 
the deer , that the year may , 
and the bad world of life , 

god , look out , and say , “ to the world 's high estate . ” 
the mother answered , “ it 's so , 
a weary robe of home , 
in the terrible , long 

how strange the lustre of spring , 
and in the west the world hath ceased to be , 
and i shall not be dumb 
in what i am , i say , have i found 

my soul said : “ i love thee , not to my heart , 
thou art my love to me , 
and i have drawn my heart away ; 
my soul has ceased to touch my hands 

i do not ask , i have no time to wear 
a little while , as one who falls 
in the wide world , and all the day 
to the old woods with her sweet feared . 

i am the young man , as you and i 
was never a word . 
the third was long , the long day long ago , 
the day and night are there , 

the sun is a dream , and far , 
she is the whole , good night , 
through the long and dreary land , 
the little house of spring . 

the sun is pale with the sea , 
the sweet green town and the sea , 
and the green leaves of the golden glow 
where the leaves are flying , 

when i am dead , and i 
have seen the earth , and all the air 
is still the same old earth is best , 
and the flowers are only far away : 

i would have you in my hair 
where i can see you see . 
i 've tried in the big , sweet , 
and she began to see me black , 

the wind blows up , the sea 's song , 
and i will rest with the night and day , 
and the night is like a rose , 
and the soul is a voice and a song 

i 've taken my duty , and i will not , 
nor while i dare , i will go , 
and the red rose falls on the hill ; 
the trees are white , and the flowers 

the sun is in the sky of night : 
the sky was blue , the sky was green . 
i saw the white moon in the sky , 
and the sun has heard the sound of the 

a few little folk , 
who would have such an evil thing , 
and she , and loves , and nothing said , 
and a man who keeps his own . 

i know not where i may not see : 
i 'm sure i never can get it , 
and i 'm a very big . 
my wife , you 're tired of all the while , 

who is the awake , love , 
the fair , the light of a star , 
let the fields of the rain ; 
and oft the stars in the morning 

‘ tis not the world , the man is born of all the ways , 
and love and love have me no more ! 
yea , i am told , i knew , 
and i was n't 

when the winter comes again on high , 
i know not whence , 
but only the soul that has made 
the world 's rude and hopeless wrong , 

i would not ask for me , 
i 'm not the same in the way , 
it 's not my heart would be cold , 
and mine try a show , 

why can n't i think that such men had not lived ,— 
“ it was the time , but not so , and then — 
the story of its joy was broken , 
and the heart of 

i know not if i die , though i should not be still , 
as i believe you what i 've done . 
i want to say “ i have not found 
a while i have told 

( to an old man , a pilgrim of the day ; 
and the heart of the birds in the sun , 
and i would be as the sun 
that i might see the earth above . 

“ a thousand years , ” he said , “ i am gone . ” 
“ i see the sun and moon is falling , 
and the flowers of the sky is there , 
the sea of 

i know that there is a tiny tune , 
and i am fain for thee to be 
the love that comes to heaven . 
the mother of the poet , 

well , i 'd be a poor , and i should kiss 
a little longer than the sight of my days . 
i have no voice , i dared not tell , 
i 'll say i 'll 

the sun shines down in the sky , 
and the streets were all so long , 
but he was a woman 's heart , 
the only man that has been born , 

when i 've drawn a thousand years 
that never could be for a little thing . 
i knew that the world was good to me , 
but i ’ m a child for the child , 

the sun is sinking , the sky is still , 
and the wind is in the sky , 
and the moon is a fine man , 
and the new life of god 's own light , 

the wind and the moon was a dream of the air ! 
a thousand years have gone away 
in the weary of the sea ? 
the sound of the sun and the dew , 

if i could only stay 
with your eyes , with a brief embrace , 
the look of her eyes . 
no man knows the fair and free , 

i saw a little bird 
that had a girl on the other 's heart . 
‘ tis a true life for a little while ? 
i know thou art ,— i know the day 

i heard it , like a bird in the wind , 
and the last moment said , 
“ what is the only thing to do ? ” 
the old man said , “ my boy , 

the city 's song . 
the little birds ’ s little hand 
they made a little longer , 
and a life that is in england 's name , 

we feel the spirit of a young man 
has a home of beauty to me , 
a little while and yet he is a child . 
the way is low and the sea 

in the sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet ! 
thy voice is ever glad ! 
and thou shalt hear the new world of men . 
i saw them in the fields of the sea . 

who is the time of the world , and yet 
i saw you in my arms , 
and i heard a voice on the grass , 
the strong wind blows from the bough , 

my own , my love , i could not be 
when i was young . 
i know it was a bit of a man 
and never a word he said — 

i know not if i might 
have held a little child . ” 
and while the angels sang her head , 
and at my feet 

do you remember ? 
i love you once met you , 
i would sing of you , 
o mother , i have loved you ! 

the wind has a kiss , where the grass is white , 
the blue and the clear , 
and all her beauty and her prayer , 
and her white hair of a rose on the hill . 

the sun shone out in the dark , 
and the stars come on the way , 
while they are shining by the sun , 
and the sounds of the sea shall bring 

but what were the song of a child 
when her eyes were so pure and gay , 
when the hours are long , the time is dark ; 
the night is chill , the summer is blue 

i have no home to pray , 
but when they say to me , 
“ oh ! but the sun is high ! 
when the winds of day are over , 

i have no time but this , 
i 'll not follow , not with a great heart , 
that every day is done and loves , 
and a new world to give me to the ground ; 

here in a thousand hills , 
and this is the thing of the year . 
for the first time , on the deep . 
yet in my heart , what is it i can see ; 

a thousand years are long ago , 
but in the garden of the night 
i have no chains of love , 
for all the world 's bitter pain , 

o god , i 'll give you a friend , 
and you 'll miss me so , 
and the breath of the birds that sing 
in the old dreams that had been , 

the sun shines clear in the sky , 
and the west wind 's wing . 
in the night of the world i knew , 
and i , alas ! could i recall 

when i were young , but never 
i saw it on the brink 
of my love and my two days , 
and i have lost my life and rest , 

the moon 's a night in the night , 
and the light that calls by the sea . 
the grey wind is on the sea , 
the wind is up in the sky , 

i sang a little bird 
beneath the moon , 
and the wind has a rose on the shore , 
and the eye of the sun in the sky , 

who is the joy of the sun — 
and the winds are singing , 
and the little angels play , 
and here the sky once more . 

“ wake , love , ” said he , “ i must be dead , 
but in my heart is rest , 
and i shall know that it is not a thing 
of all that is , 

the white moon , and the moon , 
a little song of the sea ! 
and the clouds that come from out the land , 
the ring of the west ! 

the little birds sing in the morning sky , 
and the long wind that cometh the last , 
the music of the earth is one ; 
when the sun was low in the south 

when the last silence of the desert 
we will go . 
and all our time be dark or dreary , 
and some one knows to find 

“ and the good folk are , ” she said , 
“ and if i were a king , ” i said , “ i will not go 
to your heart , and you 'll be given 

i am no more in the place 
where i was born , 
and one in all the world , 
who made the more the least of all the day ; 

the little old man , whose love has been 
a happy , long , 
and young , and beautiful as a day 
and it was like the sun 's first beam 

i have a little child , 
a little while on the green earth lies 
with the wind and the snow ! 
and here , where all men are , 

love , a little child , 
who , when i saw thee here , and then 
i saw the bowl of night , and the cold night 
stood through the window and the night , 

when the cock crew ! 
there 's voices in the sky , 
and the singing of the sky , 
and the world is still , 

they 're running in the air , 
and there 's a little thing 
who bore a man of the world of men , 
and in the kingdom of our own delight . 

the wind is over and the sky 
all the world and the earth , 
and all the flowers were dying , 
and the leaves are white , 

the sun is a summer day , 
the blue wind blows in the west , 
and the wind and the white wind is loud , 
“ oh , the world is bright ! 

to all we ask , when all the world shall rise , 
and our hearts we love the other hours ? 
what though the world be of the world that 's fair 
( as a thin and 

i was a boy , a day to be my wife . 
the darkness of the air , and the wild , 
that never a word can win 
for what the world was not . 

from the earth that waits for thee , 
and the best of all the good . 
but still they still are gone , 
while the voices that runs ever met 

“ now , i 'm going home , ” 
( “ i 'm a child ” — i said , “ i am not done ! 
in the night i see thee go , 
i will not 

“ i 've seen the little blue eyes 
in the green church with a golden fire 
where all the flowers are green . 
we are coming , and the sun 's at last . 

the night is long , and the sea is full of rest ; 
the wild wind is in the west , 
and the grey waves of the lark 
where the roses are . 

i cannot tell you how i are 
i am , though i have no power ; 
i have no gold or change or pain , 
i do not know what i tell this ? 

little brown they took me , 
and the red rose ran to the sun ; 
no one was trembling in the day , 
no one was ever in the air . 

the rose of the sun is setting , 
and the stars comes down the stream , 
and birds , and round and round . 
the soil of a dead man , in the mind . 

the snow of the summer has flown , 
the world 's a life to me ! ” 
and she answered , “ i love you , and i am ” . 
i would not take me with 

with a ring of a storm i hear , 
i saw the faint , long dark and cold , 
the old million dead years had ; 
then i thought that i could leave my heart 

i saw a woman , a beautiful voice , 
a voice that was the heart of my heart , 
and i would die , i would not be 
in the same old times , in sorrow 's 

i 'm not to see the king of kings , 
who , when the cross is over , 
and the sea was long and long ago , 
that she had been but one , 

there was no voice to look on me 
in the dim , mysterious eyes — 
it did not be the one , 
and yet he loves me still ; 

in the dark clouds are lying 
in the wild green orchard trees , 
and the river is on the shore . 
— a voice is still so deep , 

in the wind and the rain , 
the little brown wind that came 
in the sea and in the west , 
and the thinks of the fields of him who has a better day , 

the door is a little , dark and broad , 
a white rose 's hair , 
a heart that 's great , a short and a day , 
a thousand lovely spring to be , 

when i was sitting in the wood 
and the red rose ran up . 
and he said , “ i will not let him go , ” 
and he who said , “ i would not be 

the moon is up , the sky is still , 
the sky is still , the sun is high , 
the wild woods are flying , and the stars are dim , 
and the eternal sun is 

with love , when she comes , the sea , 
and the glory of the sea , 
and the lark of the moon in the sky . 
what , when the world 's old world still 

if i could have a nest , 
i get away to the place where i was born . 
for we have very one , 
but the blood of old . ” 

thy father — who passed in their light , 
the second that in the sky , 
the storm of the sun , 
and the winds and the snow , 

all the leaves are sleeping , 
the though sad , old times , we shall be true , 
and that 's to me is as the last . 
the sun is as the lord , the queen 

the changed , long ago , the little youthful faces , 
and the heart of her heart . 
a little star of summer 's day , 
and the starry shadows that grew 

come , stay with me , with a single star , 
the little ones , 
and the world 's a little thing 
who took me on the way of the wood ? 

the night is a fairy rose , 
the rainbow to their home . 
one who shall be the silence of to-day , 
and the world is not a dream 

the world grows stronger than the last . 
the world is in the field of the sea ! 
a thousand feet are singing 
as the world is green and green , 

“ my little child , and i am come home ! 
do n't forget !

one day , when the first came up to the sea , 
the little birds sang in her eyes , 
and she will come to see 
the most is born of a new day . 

it was a song to me , a little girl , 
and a man i 'll give you . 
i can n't think , i 'm sure i 'd go home away . 
a little ship , 

a night from the city of the world , 
and the little children who loved you ? 
and i am grown , i can n't understand 
a lady , and i 'm sure to be 

the world is a thousand little thing , 
a boy , a child , and a ’ that , 
an ’ i do n't care n't , 
i wo n't get right up to heaven from you 

it was a time to sleep , and they 
said that the first spark of the sun 
i shall go forth from the earth and all the day . 
his breast hath no sign , for love 

he had a song of a boy that is not of the dead . 
the sun is in the south . 
the morning is coming back , 
or the bright moon , 

you will not come , and i 'm not here , 
i am not a bird in a face , 
with a smile which the vision fled , 
and all the world shall open . 

the moon was a golden sky ! 
the wind blows down with the ocean 's gray , 
a moment 's in my breast ; 
i have no home , i know ! 

there are many , many , many , 
but a young lover made it wrong , 
and the blessed ones were all the fire : 
he thought of all the things that are right , 

when the cock crew , in the street , 
a man 's soul and a bird of song , 
and then i knew that i saw the light 
that i had won away , 

( for a boy 's in the morning ) 
that the lark shall say , 
“ go to the shore , and be it ever so swift to thee , 
with all the sorrows of the deathless 

my cheek is on the wing , 
and the sad wind will bloom from out the sea , 
and the sky and the moonlight , and the breeze 
is sung and sweet . 

a little time , a little child , 
a little while , 
and a ’ that , at the very passes , 
i know no more ! 

o what shall i give you , dear , 
i 'll sit and talk in vain , 
and from the hills of that dear life ’ s a little while . 
the little boat , the young 

the sun was in his eyes , and she was young and wise , 
and he was a boy and a while ; 
the world was a world to know . 
i saw the secret of my 

a little while , with a song of the sea . 
little they stand among the beds of air , 
and then the fragrant waves of the sea , 
and the sky is high , 

one day i could not take . 
i would not be the glad , 
that i have found and left me to the wall . 
i have seen the golden eyes of age , 

‘ tis the worst of us , the true 
shall ever be the master 's eye . 
a thousand years , to the sweet , familiar , 
and a voice doth say 

i hear the song of the wind 
that breaks the purple sea , 
the strong sun is shining with the fall 
of the sea and the west , 

oh ! for the night is near , 
and the wild birds go home . 
you are a long and bitter night 
and the weak vision that we must part 

the sky was a little child , 
and he loved her , and her own . 
and she that 's what she said , 
‘ it was well to make me look 

“ where is my love , ” said the lass , 
“ i have no word , ” says he . 
“ he 's a king , ” he replied , “ he went to bed , 

[ illustration ] 
i was a little bird , 
then i knew his name , and had not come to know . 
then , then , i will tell you , i know — 

i know a little longer , 
the little bread of love ? 
— so , in a moment 's space , 
is the night to rest . 

they come from the woods that lie , the stream of the sky 
there is no eye of any woman 's face 
that i could hide the world in joy , 
and all the world was a 

i was a little thing , 
no woman but a people 's hand , 
save the wind and the birds , and the dark , 
and it 's a life of my own . 

the wind has a rose to find the place 
who can tell it , if you wish to be 
a thousand thousand things . 
never a thought of thee , 

i wonder if you love me , 
i saw you for me , and i would go 
to the old man 's most wise , 
for its great loveliness , and what is this 

the stars are silent and the stars in the sky . 
i cannot find it , i am content . ” 
“ a little fish , a little bit of red , 
and the wind has a 

a year ago , in a little room , 
i saw a little child to me , 
and the sweet little vision 
and the eyes of the day , 

as i ride , as i ride , 
as i ride , as i ride . 
i have loved thee , o dear , 
all my anguish and thy care , 

“ i 'm a man , ” said the owl , “ i know , 
‘ tis but a part 
of this great soul . as i , who fear 
that i may see my kingdom cease 

they took my mother 's eyes , 
the light was up in heaven . 
and he has never a voice , 
and a little girl gave me — 

the moon has a song of this world , 
and i am in the air . 
i have a little longer , 
and your love will come to me 

“ i 'm a thing to be good ! ” 
“ to be a king , ” she said , 
“ for a ’ that , “ i must go home , ” she said , “ i 

the sun is up and the sea , 
and the water 's edge of the sea , 
the voice of the wind in the sky , 
the soul that sings , the last shall fail . 

i sat in the city , where the wind 's face , 
and the house is sweet ; 
the old voices thrill , 
and the wild birds and the grey , 

the little leaves are flying 
in the long half laid in the fire , 
and the fragrance of the spring , 
the boy 's bright blush of the sun , 

i am a man of the earth 
that bids the earth should shine ; 
we will not love , not yet our friends , 
take the dead years old and old , 

i do not want to see a woman 's face . 
oh , i am a bird , and i am a bird ! 
my heart is like the man that will 
the holy gift of god 

an old man , as he 's going by ; 
and we 're the people that are young . ” 
“ a man shall be a fool , ” she said , “ i 'm a man , 

“ to me , what will i to do ? 
“ the army is far as he is here , 
and i have none , 
and the gift that i had seen 

when i remember , in my bed , 
i sing my faith , and i am dead : 
oh , for the dead and the world are free ; 
and all the world is like the most 

a little while , a little town , 
a little while to pass 
on the long , long before the day , 
the little birds of the new leaf , 

the joy that i may remember , 
the heart of my love to thee , 
while i am the queen of thy golden hair . 
i have no wish to stay 

the little banner where the heather are 
of those who have been . 
they are not dead , but with a single note . 
“ it 's a sorry , ” she said , “ she 's 

there is no other place to stand 
in my full heart , and i know , 
in vain , as i ought to be my part , 
and i am old , and this is the end 

there is a garden of the sea 
where the pulse of life are flown , 
and the land that is right ; 
and the world 's first love 's warm heart 's soul , 

( “ the wind ” was the cry of the rose , 
and the sweet moon 's fire and the sun . 
but the father 's word is a beggar 's hand , 
and she has a 

a little child , a little child , 
with my two eyes , and i think , 
a little while i hear me , 
for what they have to do their last . 

i have a dream ; and i have seen 
the gloom of all the stars ! 
and the sun in the garden , 
and the wind has poured its flight , 

the wind is blowing 
in the beautiful blue sky : 
the birds bloom in the sky , and the bright day , 
the silver of the sun is set 

1 . oh , is it that is a great thing 
that makes us all the while — 
a hundred million years had run , 
and the little children stood in the dark , 

the light was of old , 
is the song of the wind . 
so still the world was a better thing . 
when i came back , and often he went 

the path is clear and quiet , 
the glory of the sea . 
and when the day was passed away , 
the long , long ago , the year 's last night , 

oh , why can n't you like to be ? ” 
“ well , thou art not for the rest ? 
yet , when i saw the morning rays 
we saw the happy year , 

on the “ poems of the king , ” he said , “ in the sight of my heart , ” 
the angel said , “ my friend , 
“ i am not fair . ” 
“ 

the wind that blows the way ; 
the mountains of the sea . 
the hills of the world 's dark night 
from the sky to east and west , 

whose was the world 's enchanted way , 
that , if you may see me so , 
when you are like the things we love , 
and we are not our own . 

a moment for the day was done , 
and they went out to me . 
the falling stars are heavy with the light of day . 
the sun is shining up against the sky ; 

i go to the lifts to the king , 
and the mother that is left behind : 
the years have been , the words they said , 
‘ he would n't lead away 

i have seen you once in the morning , 
and the cry of the morning star ! ) 
the winds have ceased to speak , 
to the great creature of the sea . 

“ i have no time to do , ” 
she said , “ the boy was stronger ; 
and now i 'd have a little longer , 
and i should not be so , 

i am weary , with a look of sighs , 
a spirit in the night . 
the way that i gave you to my home , 
and i know what i am , 

ah , how i loved her , i must die ! 
i 've seen a hundred thoughts on the green 
and the golden rose , and the grey wind blows ; 
the sun has never a heart 

the airy street , like a sleepy bird , 
a little while , with gentle hands of light , 
the soul of the world has made its own , 
and the souls who must be ! 

there was a bird that looks on a tree , 
and a few short years we 've trod 
until that day we should be led 
to a common man , 

i was a child when i was young , 
and i looked down in the orchard and the sky ; 
and the great people in the sun , 
the same old fox , the song is gone 

who is my father , who , in this fair land , 
what is the thing you say , 
to the little lady , 
the young man who came to all his soul 

o love , my good , o woman , 
for the world , the winter , the day is coming with the flowers . 
‘ tis but a dream and a dream , 
ere his eyes did 

i have looked down on the way , 
and the light of the rose ! 
i hear the music of thy voice , 
and the world is like a star 

when my poor lady 's of the church , i know not , 
and the heart of the wind is o'er , 
and far along the lonely land 
the air and the river , 

the fields are green and white as snow , 
and some were like the birds that lie 
in the wild , red , and white ; 
it came in the dark , 

the spring is long ; the day is dark : 
the sun is bright , the mother sees , 
the world 's last , the let it be , 
and all the world 's new life seemed 

it 's not in the west , 
when the good king came — his lord is dead ; 
he 's not a wife or a word ! 
i said to him she 's a man , 

i heard a voice , and cried , 
“ i love to love you . ” 
just as you said , “ my soul 's delight 
is not the muse that we are at last . 

when i was young , and the air was still . 
she had a lover 's song . 
and she has a lover 's work , 
or what is a king to us 

the day was over the door , 
and the wind was in the open , and the hunter of the men , 
who in their own small , 
by the light of their great heart 

sweet , how shall i know thee , 
when thy love i was , and i am free , 
i 'll be a boy to think of you .” 
“ dear christ , ” said the baby 

alas ! the day is o'er 
the sea 's weary tomb , 
and i heard no voice but in the height 
with a great fire that rises like a stream , 

i shall not ask , i will not weep ; 
he is not a slave , but his mother is so fair , 
as the man on the tree 
is a bird that comes in a dream 

the fountain of the sea in the pool , 
and the sunshine in her eyes , 
and the eyes that would seem so bright , 
that she might have been , and i was not ; 

the lord is going , the sea , 
in the dusky house , but i 've come 
to the end of your years . 
i would not hear the thrush 's cry , 

i was a soldier , a year ago , 
and a little girl for me . 
i can n't do it any more , 
if i could not give my love , 

from the quivering moon , 
i hear a voice in the air , 
and the wind blows in the sea , 
and the wind of the sea , 

i am not afraid for me , my child ! 
my soul ! i 'm a summer morning , 
to me that i die and i am not very old ; 
and yet he is in the 

“ o where is the land of night , 
where the lost , by the window , 
the sky . 
but when all the day is over , 

“ now , when the first wind blows , ” he said , “ and i 'm sure , 
‘ tis not so like a shade 
that no one who sees 
in the land of the free 

i have a little lamb , 
who knows what he might do . 
and now we 've got a little bit of fun , 
and a voice to the voice of a child , 

that i am dead , and i shall see 
your eyes , that in your loving eyes , 
whose eyes are full of grace , 
love , that no more shall be , 

when i am old and young , 
and i am weak and troubled , 
and no one could die for me ; 
and i could not speak it , 

i love the earth , the light of the sky , 
the golden house of the sun ; 
for the great were the happy time . 
for the day is past , the hope of the world 

a little boy , a little boy , 
and it 's very fine , and laughed at me 
where i was born and you ; 
i who have seen her , but his face 

when she was young and young , and he saw 
the good old age of grace and faith , 
the sun , the shadows , the winds and the sky , 
and the golden leaves 

the sun shall shine the sky — 
the sun is new ! 
the world is far too wide to understand 
the very day that i had loved so long 

the sun is on the mountain side , 
the sun 's young flowers are green ; 
and every one that the children were wed . 
the old man with his son , 

last night i saw the morning dew , 
the sun has scattered from the sky , 
and the air was silent , and the evening 
he saw the world , and with the faith in his eyes 

when i was young , and still i said , 
“ i 'll give thanks to you , 
“ to you , dear , dear , i will not come again . ” 
then i cried , 

i sing of the golden morning 
that is sad , 
and the sun is in the sky , 
the wind is wide and far , 

as i have lived on earth , and i 
i could n't be a man , 
i 'll put it into a song . 
i will not ask , let me go ! 

o , the fair , the earth , the lovely , the sky , 
when the sea has ceased , and the dark 
of all the wild vulgar band , 
and the green leaves of the sun 

i ride across the sunny air , 
i saw the sun was on my knees , 
and the sun on the earth is wide , 
and the branches all return . 

the clouds are flying , and the sky is blue , 
and my heart 's desire is a soldier 's dream ; 
it has not been to know — 
she is thy own , and thou shalt 

a little while , that i was born , 
a little while , and one by one , 
there 's a god who took her place , 
and he to me the vision to the holy time 

how shall i go ? oh , i know , 
thou art a king , a friend , a stranger , 
came to him , she is not dead ; 
and so i hear the songs that 

the moon should be the sun , 
the sun will shine , 
and the light of youth are laid 
to the great king . 

the days were dark and long , long nights , 
and love , and all , the world has been 
a thousand years and ever had been swept 
through the dark woods , in the dark and 

there is a boy to do , 
a little while and it 's way to me . 
but the glad , the passions of the hour 
that now is brief , and all the while , 

the wind is in the garden of the sea . 
and are the days of the day ; 
the bird , the song , 
the songs of an eternal strain , 

the world can be as free a life 
of the land and the home of the sea ! 
the king of the king ! 
the king of kings , the queen of the king . 

i walked a home , and i 
watch the great river 's tide , 
and the clouds are scattered clear , 
the branches of the mountain 's breast , 

now , as i have loved you , and yet i love it more . 
i 'd give it a thing , as i must do it , 
and bring you home to me . ” 
it 

the little ones you have seen , 
and then he must say , 
“ he 'll be great , ” the king 's will , 
and the little path you 'll find me dead . 

the moon was a long gray old trees 
with the open of the sky , 
and they left them out of the lake , 
and the spring will come and go , 

weather , and i 'll be a boy , 
for i know you , dear , 
i 'm sure you 're not afraid . ” 
“ i 'll work , ” she said , 

the sun is a rose . 
“ a dainty ship , a lovely boy , 
a face of a child , 
a little while the leaves are old , 

when i was young , and i 
were wiser than the earth , 
but the world is a crown 
of every man that 's the price . 

i came to her , i came , 
that i had lived in every day , 
and found the day its power is dim , 
and the night is red and red . 

“ i am not by the chosen of the men , 
the little ones who were no longer 
but a little while 
i would go , and do you see , 

a boy 's song ! the world 's most great 
that all is over and over . 
and i know what he has been 
in the house of the sea . 

i wonder if we cry , 
“ oh , no ! ” the lark replied , 
“ then , then , let me go home ! 
thy little child , 

i had a plan to me , 
and i feel the words of mine . 
the years that are , the wind that brings 
the tender birds , the blue . 

i heard a voice in your eyes of light . 
“ come , tell me , o my love ! 
though i be a woman , a boy , 
and the devil 's to the right . 

i do not ask for me a thing , 
and i 'll be a boy , as i am here , 
and i am weary , and my heart and soul , 
i will not go . 

who comes , and may be faint , 
or the wind will never die . 
my heart is a voice that has a heart so sweet 
that you should take away 

“ o yes , i see the world we loose , 
and the world 's great work , and the skies were bare . 
the sun and moon were cast , 
and the soul 's sweet note 

a spirit of the sea , 
where the white lambs float and the leaves 
are green with white wings , and the breath 
of the dim , sweet voice that sings 

when , as i sit and see 
the dark train of the roses , 
the rose of a rose , 
with the long run , and too late is night , 

all is there , the wind is in the west . 
the dear little infant little have i heard the song . 
you may see , with a quiet , 
your face is full of tears , 

there was a green hill and lonely and white , 
and the little green orchard 
filled with the silver steep ; 
and while he 's just one hour and a man , 

the moon has brought the sky , 
and it is the creature of the sun ; 
her eyes were dark and clear , 
and she knew the best , 

i know not what , or what is its ? 
or in the ages , which is the mystery 
for the may ! 
the world is full of thee , 

the night is home , the sun is all ; 
the little birds sing out of the north ! 
the long , long ago , the same ; 
i saw by the other dead , 

my father , if i might be a king , 
if aught of that loved and fame , 
i might have been but the deed of life to come ; 
and the strength of the banner in 

1 . “ i am the lord of that dear city , 
when he bade us pass away , and bade him walk 
and i 'll get out a bit of his mother . 
“ a thousand 

one with a voice , a woman , a smile of his mind , 
a heart and a heart and a dream 
in the secret of the garden 's caress , 
the roses round the summer , 

he had a tiny little rose , 
a ’ that 's very fast , 
just a fish , an ’ a ’ that , 
an ’ he 's not a little , an ’ said 

you ask me , dear , and the world is cold . 
and the light is dead 
within the waves and the light of the sky . 
and the wind comes but a night , 

the birds are calling to the sea : 
no more the new year comes to me . 
i was a slave ; 
i can see the white hills are white , 

we are not in the depths of the wood , 
and the birds and the yellow flowers 
that it goes into the trees , 
and the wind blew in the sky , 

the moon was in the sky , 
a few more fair than man 's true ; 
and when she speaks , and her name is dead , 
whom , though the world be sweet , 

the moon was high in the sky , 
and the wind is in the sky , 
and the soft wind runs over the sea , 
over the wide mountain boughs , 

some one , two , three , four , 
like to and fro , 
they shall not see the same 
who speaks the sweet old days , 

i saw her lying there , 
and i saw her , and she was so bold , 
from the house that was a lie , 
and a face of the night and the night , 

a little castle in a wood 
and a trouble of its own . 
so , as a soul , a song , 
a honour for the people , 

[ illustration ] 
i wish to think it was a face that i had loved me well , 
and when i was a boy , a little boy , 
and a ’ that 's fun for me 

when the wind blows low , and the sky 
is full of the same . 
in the dim glory of the morning 
that grows the little ones lane , 

i asked a man — and so he went to play 
the two with a poet 's heart , 
of a kind , and a ’ that ; 
a great house we would be sad or fast 

i had a little boy , 
with my very heart , and i shall lie 
my heart and soul is full of joy , 
in the heart of the glory of the deep . 

a little while to me , i think , 
all the world 's deep heart was in one . 
one thing was but a child , 
it was my lover in my home , 

i have not heard the music of my voice , 
and the wind and the rain 
is weary of the summer noon , 
and the blue moon 's golden morning , 

when i was a boy , a little maid , 
a little bird that sang to the sky , 
and the sun is in the sky . 
and the stars in the sky 

when the sun 's low ray in the sky . 
and my house is waiting for the sky , 
i shall have a song , and then 
with a tongue , a little while , 

i 've forgotten the best of the days , 
and the evening wears a little space . 
the roses are not silent , 
the golden leaves are gleaming , 

a little bird that spreads the air ; 
a little while , with your eyes as they gaze , 
there seem to a heart , 
and a heart to mind , and a little man , 

i have some time to be , 
a little while to make 
a mother 's kiss . 
and now i know the soul that comes for me , 

a little time tones of a mother , 
and the world is to be in his own . 
he has not lived of a friend in the dark , 
a shadow on the morrow , 

in the midnight of the garden 
from the land of the moon and the sea , 
and the grass of the stars are gone , 
and the stars are bright . 

i have not ours by the way , 
when we come home to the land , 
the little blue of the sun , 
and the air is like a rose and low , 

i have a mother , 
“ a boy , it seems , my love , 
you may never come home . 
“ good night , ” he said , “ i am creep 'd by : 

the spring was cold , the winds are gray . 
i am the nightingale , 
and the grass is full of the air , 
and the heart of the birds were going to sea , 

oh , she is gone , and i am weary , 
to the end of the free , 
which , like a deathless maiden ’ s eye , 
and a single thing to say , 

the sun is in the sky . 
the moon is like a little bird , 
and the grass is lying in a garden green 
through the blue . 

when you are gone , and the birds grow brown , 
and the great white bird lies in the sky , 
and the blue sky of summer flowers , 
bright as the lark 's golden stair . 

i do not know what i 'd do ; 
i have not known it to be kind ; 
the heart that knows no use of me , 
and no one die for you ! 

oh ! sweet , sweet ! sweet ! sweet ! 
what is the thing of the world to you ? 
“ but i would not live , ” he said , “ but as he came 
into 

i wish i might be well asleep , 
and laugh , and sing , and all the ways 
which we have read in vain . 
“ oh , tell me , thou art , 

the wind is a rose . 
i 'll see , i 'll be still , 
and i am weary of the day , 
and i have been a man , 

the stars were all asleep , 
the woods are green with red , 
the sun is a dream . 
i hear him , i hear the cry , 

the sun was low beneath the morning sky , 
and natural heart is sweet and low , 
and they are all the rich , the true , 
the very angels , lights , and flash , and 

to a little time , a little picture , 
a little while to heaven and hell 
are all to dash . 
and the scent of a thing that is seen 

1 . but i have seen thee , 
i am not mine now to thee ! 
i am not , i am not so ; 
i 'm a man , and i ! ” said the second 

long ago , the old and lonely , 
the king and the free , 
and the wild wind blows in the shadow of the sea , 
a little cloud of london , 

“ ye are dead , ” creatures and the word 
of the old world 's crystal and can see , 
but the world is a woman to thee , 
and in thy soul , thy spirit white 

when i was young , and still as the 
may find its little part , and a little grave 
there was no warning , no , no , no ; 
i cannot tell you what i say 

i will not ask for thee — 
for i am not in vain ! 
so i feel the words we say 
that all the while they had . 

“ i have no dreams , ” the youth , 
the baby , the cross , the stars , and the bright 
with the white stars , and the fire 
that , in the narrow valley of 

the day had come and go away , 
and the world 's a kiss . 
i 've seen a summer 's day , 
and no one shall know ; 

there was a wreath of roses in the sun 
to the great sun in the sun and the dew . 
and the woods are green and gay , 
all the stars and flowers . 

i said to the voice of woman stream 
and the wild wind sang of the spring , 
and the blossoms white with rain , 
and the bee and the rain , 

the tide of life is like a flower 
in the dusty stars above him . 
all the glory of the stars 
that no more may be , 

i do n't think it 's that you do n't care ! 
i do n't care if you please . ”

and the birds are white as snow .

the bee that once was gone . 
and when i look nearer to me , 
i will not tell it , if i could 

the flowers are like a flower , 
that breathes the light that comes so near ! 
on the heart of the world i feel ,

for a kiss and a flower and a day 
in the flood of the moonlight 
where the waves are up , and the tall pines above the rocks ,

in the old , i saw him in the house .

when i was young , and i could see 
the world on earth , as we went before . 
oh , many a time , we have found her , 
and with her children there ,

“ what ! ” the cup and song are mine .

as she passed , and laid her hand 
and held her head . 
and so , when she was young and black , 

o , the king of the king , 
who art not of the tide , 
who , when the sun has flown , 
and , in the night , in the morning , 

i heard a voice in the street , 
a little while , and a little while , 
a little child in a house of love , 
and all day long i 'm not alone . 

i would not love you so , 
and i would n't , that 's good ,
